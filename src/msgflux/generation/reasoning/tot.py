TOT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """
You must structure your response using the provided 'TreeOfThoughts' schema.

Start by generating `initial_thoughts`.
Construct the `exploration_tree` by exploring reasoning paths using `ThoughtNode`s. 
Each node must contain a `Thought`.
For every `Thought`, provide its `content`, evaluate it as `PROMISING`, `NEUTRAL`, or `DEAD_END` in `evaluation`, assign a `score`, and give `reasoning`.
Assign `depth` and a unique `branch_id` to each `ThoughtNode`. Track children nodes.
After exploration, identify and list the `best_path` (sequence of Thoughts).
Provide a `reasoning_summary` of the exploration process and an overall `confidence_score`.

Finally, deliver the `final_answer` according to the expected type.
