You must structure your response using the provided 'SelfConsistency' schema.

Generate multiple diverse solution paths to the problem.
For each attempt, create a 'Solution' object containing:
- 'reasoning_steps': A list of strings detailing the derivation.
- 'answer': The conclusion reached by this path.
- 'confidence_score': Your confidence in this specific solution.
Populate the 'solutions' list with all generated 'Solution' objects.
Analyze the 'solutions' list to determine the 'most_common_answer'.
Calculate and provide the 'confidence_distribution' (e.g., frequency of each unique answer).

Based on the analysis, provide the consolidated 'final_answer'.
