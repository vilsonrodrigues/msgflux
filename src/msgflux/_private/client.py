class BaseClient(ABC, Core):
    """
    BaseClient is an abstract base class that defines the interface and common behavior
    for client classes in the msgflux system.

    This class inherits from `Core` to leverage its state management capabilities and
    extends it with additional functionality specific to clients. It requires subclasses
    to implement certain methods, ensuring a consistent interface across different client
    implementations.

    Subclasses must implement the `_initialize` and `__call__` methods, which are
    essential for client initialization and operation, respectively. Additionally, this
    class provides methods for serialization and deserialization, allowing client instances
    to be easily saved and restored.

    Attributes:
        to_ignore ([optional[list[str]]): A list of attribute keys to be ignored during serialization.
        msgflux_type (str): A string identifying the type of the client in the msgflux system.
        provider (optional[str]): The provider associated with the client, if applicable.
        instance_type (optional[callable]): A method or callable that returns additional
            instance-specific data to be included during serialization.
