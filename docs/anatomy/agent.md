# Agent

`Agent` is the orchestration center of msgFlux.

Most of the library's higher-level behavior passes through it:

- input preparation
- prompt assembly
- provider execution
- structured output handling
- native tool calling
- custom tool loops via `ToolFlowControl`
- response formatting and delivery

If you only draw one module to understand the runtime, draw `Agent` first.

## Mental Model

`Agent` does not own every detail. It coordinates specialized subsystems.

```text
input/message
  -> Agent
     -> templates and task preparation
     -> ToolLibrary schemas
     -> provider call
     -> response processing
        -> native tool loop, or
        -> ToolFlowControl loop, or
        -> final response formatting
```

The important part is the branching after the provider call. `Agent` can follow
three main paths:

- plain response
- native provider tool calling
- custom flow control loop

## Main Flow

The normal synchronous path looks like this:

```text
message / kwargs
  -> Agent.forward(...)
  -> _prepare_inputs(...)
  -> _execute_model(...)
     -> _prepare_model_execution(...)
     -> generator(...)
     -> provider model call
  -> _process_model_response(...)
     -> maybe native tool loop
     -> maybe ToolFlowControl loop
     -> _prepare_response(...)
  -> response
```

The async path mirrors the same structure through `aforward`, `_aexecute_model`,
and `_aprocess_model_response`.

## Generation Schema And Signature

One of the easiest ways to misunderstand `Agent` is to treat
`generation_schema`, `typed_parser`, and `signature` as unrelated features.

They are different entry points into the same contract-building phase.

### Direct `generation_schema`

When `generation_schema` is passed directly, it defines the structured output
shape that the provider should produce and that the runtime should consume.

Typical cases:

- a plain `msgspec.Struct` output
- a reasoning schema such as `ChainOfThought`
- a custom flow control schema such as `ReAct`

### `typed_parser`

`typed_parser` is not the same thing as `generation_schema`.

It influences how the expected output is described and parsed, but it does not
replace the role of `generation_schema` as the runtime output contract.

In practice:

- `generation_schema` defines the shape of structured output
- `typed_parser` defines a parser-oriented output strategy

That is why these features appear together in the preparation path, but they
should not be mentally merged into one mechanism.

### `signature`

A signature is a higher-level configuration source.

When `signature` is provided, `Agent` compiles several internal pieces from it:

- input annotations
- task template
- instructions
- expected output
- output struct used as generation schema

So, from the perspective of `Agent` anatomy, a signature is not just a prompt
shortcut. It is a contract compiler.

### Signature + Generation Schema

The most important special case is combining a signature with an explicit
`generation_schema`.

In that path, `Agent` does not discard one in favor of the other. Instead, it
fuses them:

- the signature still defines the typed output fields
- the explicit `generation_schema` remains the outer structure
- the signature output becomes the type of `final_answer`

This is what allows combinations such as:

- signature + `ChainOfThought`
- signature + `ReAct`
- signature + other reasoning schemas with `final_answer`

Conceptually, the merge looks like this:

```text
signature outputs
  -> StructFactory.from_signature(...)
  -> Output struct

generation_schema with final_answer
  + Output struct as final_answer type
  -> fused generation schema
```

That fused schema is what later enters provider preparation and response
normalization.

## What Happens Before The Model Call

`_prepare_model_execution(...)` assembles the provider-facing execution params.

That step is where `Agent` combines:

- current chat `messages`
- rendered `system_prompt`
- `prefilling`
- `stream`
- `typed_parser`
- `generation_schema`
- tool schemas from `ToolLibrary`

The tool surface remains a thread-scoped `ToolCatalogView` while the Agent
filters tools, resolves `tool_choice`, renders prompt guidance, and runs
`transform_tool_catalog` hooks. This preserves canonical registry metadata and
prevents Agent extensions from rebuilding partial provider-shaped schemas.
The current Model boundary receives a compatibility `ToolCatalog` adapter;
provider compilation remains outside the Agent.

When no custom flow control is involved, tool schemas can be passed directly to
the provider as native tool definitions.

When the generation schema is a `ToolFlowControl`, the behavior changes:

- tool schemas are rendered into the system prompt using the flow's template
- native provider tool calling is disabled for that request
- flow-specific tool schema metadata is passed to the provider adapter

This is how ReAct can keep a custom loop without changing the default agent
loop.

## Contract Compilation View

A useful way to read the module is to separate two stages:

```text
configuration stage
  -> signature
  -> generation_schema
  -> typed_parser
  -> templates / instructions / annotations

execution stage
  -> messages
  -> system prompt
  -> provider params
  -> model output
  -> loops / normalization / final response
```

`Agent` sits across both stages.

That is why its code can look broader than a plain runtime orchestrator:
it is both the place where the contract is assembled and the place where that
contract is executed.

## Execution Branches

After the provider returns, `Agent` decides how to continue based on
`response_type` and `generation_schema`.

### 1. Plain Response

If the model returns plain text or a normal structured object, `Agent` just
extracts the raw data and formats the final response.

```text
provider response
  -> _extract_raw_response(...)
  -> _prepare_response(...)
  -> response_mode handling
  -> final output
```

### 2. Native Provider Tool Calls

If the provider returns a native tool call payload, `Agent` enters the built-in
tool loop.

```text
provider response_type == "tool_call"
  -> _process_tool_call_response(...)
  -> ModelResponse.get_tool_intents()
  -> _process_tool_intents(...)
  -> ToolLibrary.execute_intents(...)
  -> ModelResponse.render_tool_outcomes(...)
  -> messages.extend(provider continuation)
  -> _execute_model(...) again
```

This loop continues until the provider stops returning tool calls. `Agent`
orchestrates the loop but does not know whether the continuation uses Chat
Completions messages or Responses `function_call_output` items. That encoding
belongs to the Model response that decoded the calls.

After each execution batch, `resolve_tool_feedback` extensions decide whether
the loop continues. The core defaults to continuing. The builtin
`DefaultToolFeedbackExtension` implements `direct`, `handoff`, and
`call_as_response`, so adding another feedback policy does not require changing
the Agent loop.

### 3. ToolFlowControl

If `generation_schema` is a subclass of `ToolFlowControl`, `Agent` delegates
the loop semantics to the flow control.

```text
provider structured response
  -> _process_tool_flow_control_response(...)
  -> flow_control.extract_flow_result(...)
     -> complete? yes -> finish
     -> complete? no  -> execute tools
  -> _process_tool_call(...)
  -> ToolLibrary(...)
  -> flow_control.inject_results(...)
  -> flow_control.build_history(...)
  -> _execute_model(...) again
```

This keeps the loop generic:

- `Agent` owns orchestration
- `ToolFlowControl` owns loop semantics
- `ToolLibrary` owns tool execution

## Agent And ToolLibrary

`Agent` does not execute tools directly. It always delegates tool execution to
`ToolLibrary`.

The dependency is narrow and intentional:

```text
Agent
  -> ToolLibrary.get_tool_catalog()
  -> ToolLibrary.execute_intents(...) / aexecute_intents(...)
```

That means `Agent` relies on `ToolLibrary` for two separate concerns:

- definition/catalog concerns:
  stable logical definitions and the active catalog view
- runtime concerns:
  executing canonical intents and collecting canonical outcomes

This is why `ToolLibrary` matters even when the active provider never uses
native tool calling directly.

## Why This Shape Matters

This module boundary keeps msgFlux extensible without collapsing everything
into provider code or into custom agents.

The design goal is:

- `Agent` should stay the stable coordinator
- providers should adapt transport concerns
- `ToolFlowControl` should define custom loop semantics
- `ToolLibrary` should stay the execution boundary for tools

Once you read the system through that lens, the newer transport-schema work
becomes much easier to place.
