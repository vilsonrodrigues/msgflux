# Agent Inbox

This page records the notification primitive used by `Agent`.

The goal is to make runtime notifications pluggable, durable, and
easy to inject into model execution without hard-coding every new signal inside
the core tool loop.

## Goals

- provide one runtime primitive for agent-visible notifications
- let tasks, checkpoints, budget tracking, and registry updates publish through
  the same contract
- avoid adding ad hoc message-building logic across the codebase
- keep delivery centralized in `Agent`
- prepare a clean path for future hooks and streamed runtime events

## Primitives

The current design uses two core objects:

- `AgentNotification`: one structured runtime notification
- `AgentInbox`: the queue/store responsible for publish, dedupe, coalescing,
  and delivery

Recommended shape:

```python
@dataclass
class AgentNotification:
    notification_id: str
    source: str
    ref: str | None = None
    status: str | None = None
    hint: str | None = None
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    dedupe_key: str | None = None
    created_at: str | None = None
```

Notes:

- `source` identifies the origin, for example `task`, `context_budget`,
  `checkpoint`, or `tool_registry`
- `ref` points to the concrete object, for example `task_id` or `run_id`
- `status` stays simple and machine-friendly
- `hint` is the short instruction the model can act on
- `metadata` carries extra fields without changing the base contract
- `dedupe_key` allows coalescing repeated updates

## Inbox API

The current `AgentInbox` stays small:

- `publish(notification)`
- `publish_many(notifications)`
- `peek()`
- `drain()`
- `ack(notification_ids)`
The inbox is a runtime primitive, not just a renderer.

That means it is responsible for:

- holding pending notifications
- deduplicating noisy updates
- deciding what is delivered together in the next injection
- exposing a single batch to `Agent`

## Delivery Model

`Agent` remains the only component that injects notifications into model input.

The recommended delivery point is `_prepare_model_execution()`, not
`_prepare_inputs()`.

This matters because `_prepare_model_execution()` runs both:

- on the first turn
- before each new provider call during tool loops and flow-control loops

That gives one safe boundary for delivery without scattering injection logic
through the rest of the execution path.

The flow is:

```text
runtime producer publishes AgentNotification
  -> AgentInbox stores it
  -> Agent._prepare_model_execution() drains pending notifications
  -> Agent renders one synthetic message
  -> provider call receives that message with the rest of the history
```

More concretely:

```text
background tool / checkpoint / hook
              |
              v
     AgentNotification(...)
              |
              v
      AgentInbox.publish()
              |
              v
   Agent._prepare_model_execution()
              |
              v
     AgentInbox.drain() + render()
              |
              v
<system_note><notifications>...</notifications></system_note>
              |
              v
         provider call
```

## Rendering

The renderer should build one synthetic message containing a `<system_note>`
with a `<notifications>` envelope.

Example:

```xml
<system_note>
<notifications>
<notification source="task" ref="abcd1234" status="completed">
hint=use task_output(task_id='abcd1234')
</notification>
<notification source="context_budget" ref="run_1" status="warning">
usage_percent=92
hint=be concise and avoid repeating prior context
</notification>
</notifications>
</system_note>
```

Why one message:

- it reduces message noise
- it keeps the system-visible content grouped
- it allows multiple runtime sources to deliver together

## Context Propagation

`AgentInbox` should be propagated through `execution_context`, alongside:

- `session_id`
- `run_id`
- `parent_run_id`
- `root_run_id`
- `checkpoint_store`

That lets runtime producers publish without importing `Agent` or returning
special payloads through normal outputs.

Example direction:

```python
with execution_context(
    session_id=...,
    run_id=...,
    checkpoint_store=...,
    agent_inbox=inbox,
):
    ...
```

## Producers

Any runtime component should be able to publish directly to the inbox through
the current execution context.

Current and planned producers include:

- background task completion/failure
- task progress updates
- checkpoint restore/replay signals
- context budget warnings
- tool registry changes after `inject_library`

The important rule is:

- producers publish structured notifications
- producers do not build synthetic user messages

## Coalescing

Coalescing is necessary for progress-like updates.

For example, one background task may emit five progress updates before the
agent reaches the next provider boundary. The inbox should be able to keep only
the latest relevant update by `dedupe_key`.

That allows simple producers:

```python
inbox.publish(
    AgentNotification(
        source="task_progress",
        ref=task_id,
        status="update",
        dedupe_key=f"task_progress:{task_id}",
        metadata={"step": 3, "of": 5},
    )
)
```

Without requiring a more complex progress-specific protocol in the task API.

## Persistence

The inbox should support durable storage, because notifications should be able
to survive process restart and replay.

This means `AgentInbox` should be designed as a real store boundary, not just
an in-memory queue.

## Hooks

The inbox should be easy to extend through the hook system.

The cleanest way to do that is to expose stable methods on the inbox itself,
then allow hooks to observe or transform around those methods.

Examples of useful hook points:

- before `publish`
- after `publish`
- before `drain`
- after `drain`
- before render
- after render

This avoids editing core `Agent` code every time a new notification source is
introduced.

## Relation To Future Events

This primitive should not be confused with future streamed runtime events.

The planned separation is:

- runtime events: everything that can happen in the system
- agent inbox notifications: the curated subset delivered to the model

That separation keeps the future event system broad without forcing the model
to see every internal event directly.

## Current Direction

The current direction is:

- introduce `AgentNotification`
- introduce `AgentInbox`
- propagate the inbox through `execution_context`
- inject notifications from `_prepare_model_execution()`
- let runtime producers publish structured notifications directly
- keep rendering centralized in one place
- persist notifications in history by default
