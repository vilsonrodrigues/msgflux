# ToolLibrary

`ToolLibrary` is the execution boundary for tools in msgFlux.

It sits between orchestration and implementation:

- `Agent` decides that a tool must be called
- `ToolLibrary` resolves and executes that call
- each `Tool` instance performs the actual local or remote work

This separation is important because schema concerns and execution concerns
meet here.

## What It Owns

`ToolLibrary` owns these responsibilities:

- registering local and remote tools
- routing tools into buckets when a bucket capture matches their configuration
- compiling each tool once into a stable logical definition
- projecting provider-neutral catalog entries from those definitions
- executing prepared tool calls
- normalizing execution feedback into `ToolOutcome` values

It does not decide when a tool should be called. That remains the job of the
provider response path or of a `ToolFlowControl`.

## Registry And Executor Ownership

`ToolRegistry` owns stable `ToolDefinition` values and produces `ToolRef` and
`ToolCatalogView` projections. It deliberately does not register executor
modules. Executor ownership belongs to the `ToolLibrary` facade so one module
has exactly one place in the module tree and `state_dict`.

The current facade keeps directly exposed executors in its public `ModuleDict`.
Bucket-captured definitions are indexed by the same registry, while their
executors remain owned by the bucket metadata as before. Consequently, public,
deferred, and bucket-captured tools all resolve through one definition registry
without making hidden tools appear in the model-facing module surface.

`ToolLibraryV2` follows the same boundary with its own executor `ModuleDict`.
Deep copies preserve the identity between each copied definition and its copied
executor because both are owned by the containing facade, not independently by
the registry.

## Two Phases

`ToolLibrary` participates in two different phases of the runtime.

### 1. Definition And Catalog Time

When a tool is registered, `ToolLibrary` compiles its implementation, schema,
dispatch policy, feedback policy, context bindings, and loading policy into one
immutable `ToolDefinition`. Runtime code reads that definition instead of
reinterpreting `tool_config` flags for every call.

The definition also retains a stable snapshot of the normalized declaration
for compatibility lifecycle hooks and the legacy background-task adapter. This
snapshot is not a second policy source: dispatch, feedback, loading, context,
kind, schema, and execution all use their typed `ToolDefinition` fields. It only
allows older `before_dispatch` handlers to keep reading `event.config` while
those handlers migrate to typed `ToolPolicy` payloads. Mutating a callable's or
executor's `tool_config` after registration does not change runtime behavior;
remove and add the tool again to compile a new definition.

Before the model runs, other modules ask `ToolLibrary` for a catalog view. The
current compatibility methods remain available:

- `get_tool_json_schemas()`
- `get_tool_annotations()`

Those methods are used for different reasons.

`get_tool_json_schemas()` supports:

- native provider tool calling
- prompt rendering for custom tool loops
- dynamic provider schemas such as ReAct action variants

`get_tool_annotations()` supports:

- transport restoration after structured output decoding
- typed reconstruction of lowered values before local tool execution

### Canonical Catalog Projection

`ToolCatalogView` is the canonical, immutable catalog snapshot. The registry
projects it from stable definitions plus thread-local loaded names. Every entry
retains the provider-neutral schema, annotations, strict mode, execution
namespace, native bindings, tool kind, display metadata, and stable `ToolRef`.
The view therefore contains enough information for a Model adapter without
accessing an executor or reading `tool_config` again.

The library explicitly selects which registered definitions belong to its
model-facing surface. A normal executable bucket appears as one public tool;
its captured children remain resolvable in the registry but do not leak into
the catalog. The deferred-search bucket intentionally exposes its captured
children because they are the searchable definitions.

Search is identified by the entry's `catalog_role="search"`, not by a reserved
tool name. `entries` remains stable for the lifetime of the snapshot, while
`visible_entries()` derives the portable callable surface. It exposes loaded
or directly selected deferred tools and includes the portable search entry only
while unresolved deferred tools remain.

`ToolCatalog` is currently a compatibility adapter produced by
`ToolCatalog.from_view(...)` for Agent and Model paths that have not migrated
yet. This conversion is one-way: registration, loading, filtering, and choice
validation happen in the canonical view rather than in the legacy catalog.

### 2. Runtime

The Model decodes provider calls into `ToolIntent` values. The Agent passes
those intents to `ToolLibrary.execute_intents(...)` or
`ToolLibrary.aexecute_intents(...)`, which execute the canonical runtime path
and return ordered `ToolOutcome` values.

`forward(...)`, `aforward(...)`, and `ToolResponses` adapt that canonical path
for custom `ToolFlowControl` implementations that still use tuple calls.

Feedback is declarative at this boundary. `ToolLibrary` attaches the compiled
`FeedbackSpec` to each outcome, but does not decide whether that feedback ends
the Agent run. Agent extensions own that orchestration decision.

That runtime path applies tool configuration rules such as:

- `return_direct`
- `call_as_response`
- `detached`
- `inject_vars`
- `inject_message`
- `inject_messages`
- `handoff`
- `disable_input`

This keeps the execution policy centralized instead of spreading it across
`Agent`, provider adapters, and tool implementations.

## The Execution Flow

The synchronous path looks like this:

```text
ToolIntent
  -> ToolLibrary.execute_intents(...)
  -> resolve tool by name
  -> read compiled ToolDefinition
  -> run before_tool runtime policies
  -> prepare call params
  -> run before_tool lifecycle hooks
  -> build ToolExecutionPlan
  -> run before_dispatch lifecycle hooks
  -> run before_dispatch runtime policies
     -> blocked: emit tool.blocked and return a tool error
  -> execute tools with scatter_gather
  -> run after_tool lifecycle hooks
  -> run after_tool runtime policies
  -> return one ToolOutcome per ToolIntent
```

The async path mirrors the same structure through `aexecute_intents(...)` and
`ascatter_gather(...)`. `ToolExecutionPlan` freezes the selected tool, visible
arguments, runtime arguments, dispatch mode, and return policy before either
path dispatches it.

`execute_intents(...)` and `aexecute_intents(...)` are the primary execution
boundary. The older `forward(...)` and `aforward(...)` APIs convert tuple calls
to `ToolIntent`, execute that same path, and render the outcomes as
`ToolResponses`. The compatibility object is therefore no longer part of the
Agent or canonical runtime path.

Both pre-execution hook chains are sequential per call. The first `block`
short-circuits the remaining handlers for that event invocation, including
hooks inherited from the Agent when a library extension already denied the
call. It does not stop preparation of sibling calls. `tool.blocked` is the
terminal event for the denied call; `tool.start`, `after_tool`, and `tool.end`
belong only to implementations that actually started.

Runtime policies use the owned extension registry shared with dispatchers.
They operate on `ToolIntent`, `ToolExecutionPlan`, and `ToolOutcome` rather than
the compatibility hook events. Policies are sequential and monotonic: the first
blocked outcome ends that phase for one intent. A failure before execution
fails closed, while a failure in `after_tool` preserves the outcome already
produced. Lifecycle hooks remain inside this canonical policy envelope during
the compatibility period.

Runtime argument injection uses the same registry. `runtime_inputs` compiles to
immutable `ContextBinding` values on `ToolDefinition`; the model sees neither
the binding nor its target parameter. `ToolContextProvider` resolves each
source against a per-intent `ToolRuntimeContext`, allowing custom runtime data
without another conditional in the library core. Handles are scoped to the
current tool call before they enter that context.

`before_dispatch` receives the public arguments and the registration-time
config snapshot alongside the selected `dispatch_mode`. Runtime injections
remain private. Extensions may
reduce `background` or `detached` to `foreground`, but cannot promote attached
execution into a detached mode. When a mode changes, the library rebuilds the
reserved call arguments before dispatch.

## Extensions And Core Invariants

`ToolLibraryExtension` owns optional packages of tools, hooks, setup, and
cleanup. `ToolDispatch` owns one open dispatch name in the runtime registry.
Library lifecycle hooks run before hooks inherited from an owning Agent. The
extension mechanism powers deferred tool search, background task controls, MCP
server integration, and application-defined dispatch modes.

Foreground, background, and detached execution are default `ToolDispatch`
extensions rather than branches selected by the core. A tool may select another
registered mode through `tool_config(dispatch="name")`. Batch execution remains
concurrent because every selected dispatcher contributes an async operation to
the same gather boundary.

The core continues to own deterministic registration and bucket routing,
transport restoration, runtime injection, abort handling, telemetry, and plan
dispatch. Extensions can participate at stable lifecycle boundaries but cannot
bypass these invariants.

## Local And Remote Tools

The library can store both local and MCP-backed tools behind the same
interface.

```text
ToolLibrary
  -> LocalTool
  -> MCPTool
```

That means the caller does not need different orchestration logic for:

- a Python function
- an `nn.Module`-style tool
- a proxied MCP tool

The library normalizes all of them into a single execution surface.

## Deferred Tools

`ToolLibrary` can also keep tools registered without exposing them immediately
to the model.

The contract is intentionally small:

- `@tool_config(defer_loading=True)` keeps the tool out of the initial portable
  callable surface
- deferred tools are captured by the builtin `tool_search` bucket
- if at least one deferred tool exists, `ToolLibrary` registers `tool_search`
- `tool_search` can search both local and MCP-backed deferred tools
- keyword searches return matching tool names, and `description=True` includes
  tool metadata
- `select=["tool_name"]` records matching names in the current
  `ChatMessages.metadata`

This is useful when a session can register a large number of tools but should
keep the active tool context small.

An explicitly injected `ToolLibraryHandle` is the natural companion feature
here: a tool can add a new deferred tool at runtime, and `ToolLibrary` will
expose `tool_search` automatically if needed.

`ToolSearchExtension` installs `tool_search`, which is both a builtin operator
and a `ToolBucket` with
`capture={"defer_loading": True}`. It owns the searchable metadata, while the
thread's `ChatMessages` owns which names have been loaded. The shared library is
never mutated by a selection, so concurrent threads can expose different tool
subsets safely.

Background task control tools follow the same pattern through
`BackgroundTasksExtension`, backed by `ToolBackground`.
The `task_status`, `task_wait`, `task_output`, `task_interrupt`,
`task_activity`, and `task_message` tools are callable objects with
reserved background tool kinds: the common controls use `"background"`,
activity uses `"background_activity"`, and messaging uses
`"background_message"`. `ToolLibrary` asks `ToolBackground` to reconcile the
surface from currently registered tools. `ToolBackground` derives the common
controls from background execution and the optional controls from the union of
declared `background_capabilities`.

## Tool Buckets

Some tools are not independent public tools. They are better represented as
members of another tool.

`ToolBucket` is the base type for that pattern:

```python
class ToolBucket:
    tool_kind = "bucket"
    capture: Mapping[str, Any]

    def add(self, tool: ToolMetadata) -> None:
        ...

    def refresh(self) -> None:
        ...
```

`capture` matches entries in `tool_config`. For example,
`{"tool_kind": "agent", "defer_loading": False}` captures regular agents, while
`{"defer_loading": True}` captures every deferred tool. Every entry must match.
`capture["tool_kind"]` can name one kind or several kinds separated by `|`,
such as `"catalog|orders"`.

Two bucket captures cannot overlap. This makes routing deterministic without a
priority system. A kind bucket that coexists with deferred tools should include
`"defer_loading": False`, leaving `{"defer_loading": True}` to `tool_search`. The
base executable bucket rejects captured tools that configure
`background`, `allow_background`, `detached`, `call_as_response`,
`return_direct`, or `handoff`; these model-loop policies belong to the
public bucket. `ToolSearchTool` overrides this validation because it catalogs
deferred tools rather than proxy-executing them behind its own call.

`ToolLibrary` routes matching tools to `ToolBucket.add(...)`. The base method
keeps metadata in `bucket.tools`, rejects duplicate names, and calls
`bucket.refresh()`. The base refresh hook does nothing; a subclass can rebuild
derived presentation data such as its description and usage guidance.

Buckets do not call `ToolMetadata.impl` to execute a child. An injected
`ToolBucketHandle` accepts `handle(tool_name, **arguments)` and
`handle.acall(...)`, validates membership, resolves the captured `LocalTool` or
`MCPTool`, and creates a canonical `ToolIntent`. The intent re-enters the same
policy, hook, argument-preparation, dispatch, abort, event, and telemetry path
used by a top-level tool call. The handle unwraps a successful `ToolOutcome`
back to the plain value expected by bucket implementations; a failed outcome is
raised at the proxy boundary and becomes the public bucket call's error. The
bucket never executes `ToolMetadata.impl` directly.

The registration rule is:

- if a registered bucket matches the tool configuration, the bucket captures it
- otherwise, the tool is registered normally

When a bucket is registered, it also captures matching tools that are already
registered. Therefore, the order of `tools` in `ToolLibrary(...)` does not
change capture behavior.

For agents, `nn.Agent` is normalized to `tool_config["tool_kind"]="agent"`.
`AgentTool` is a bucket with
`capture={"tool_kind": "agent", "defer_loading": False}`, so adding an agent to
a library that already has `AgentTool` updates the single public
`agent(name, message)` tool instead of exposing the agent as a separate tool.

```python
library = ToolLibrary(
    name="team",
    tools=[
        AgentTool(),
        reviewer_agent,
        planner_agent,
    ],
)
```

The model only sees `agent(...)`. The bucket description and usage guidance are
refreshed on the wrapping `LocalTool`, so provider schemas and prompt guidance
reflect the captured agents.

The public parameters stay as `agent(name, message)`. `AgentTool` receives a
scoped bucket handle carrying the parent call context. When it selects a child,
`ToolLibrary` reapplies that child's configuration: for example,
`inject_messages=True` gives the child agent a copy of the parent's history,
while an agent without that option receives no inherited history. The scoped
handle itself keeps the original context references; copying happens only while
preparing a selected agent call. Agent execution namespaces are normalized from
the agent's canonical module name, so a public tool alias does not change its
checkpoint identity.

Deferred agents are captured by `tool_search` and represented as logical tools
in `ToolCatalog`. Once loaded for a thread, the provider can call the agent by
its own tool name without promoting it into the shared `AgentTool` bucket.

## Typed Restoration

One of the most important newer responsibilities of this layer is restoring
transport-lowered arguments back to the logical tool parameter types.

For local tools, that work happens in `LocalTool._restore_transport_params(...)`
using the original annotations.

That means a model can return a provider-friendly transport shape such as:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "entries": [
      {"key": "city", "value": "Austin"},
      {"key": "country", "value": "USA"}
    ]
  }
}
```

and the local tool still receives:

```python
{"fields": {"city": "Austin", "country": "USA"}}
```

This is the point where transport compatibility is converted back into runtime
types.

## Agent Relationship

The relationship between `Agent` and `ToolLibrary` is intentionally narrow.

```text
Agent
  -> ToolLibrary.get_tool_json_schemas()
  -> ToolLibrary.get_tool_annotations()
  -> ToolLibrary(...) / ToolLibrary.acall(...)
```

That gives `Agent` just enough surface area to:

- expose tools to providers
- build custom flow-control schemas
- execute tool calls

without turning `Agent` itself into a tool registry or argument decoder.

This is the role of `ToolLibrary` in the larger flow:

```

## Why This Shape Matters

If tool execution lived directly in `Agent`, every new transport rule,
injection rule, or remote-tool integration would make the orchestrator more
fragile.

If schema restoration lived only in provider code, local tool execution would
become provider-specific.

`ToolLibrary` keeps that boundary clean:

- `Agent` stays focused on orchestration
- providers stay focused on transport and decoding
- tool implementations stay focused on business logic
