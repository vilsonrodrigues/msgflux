# Text to Speech

The `text_to_speech` model converts text into natural-sounding spoken audio. These models enable voice generation for accessibility, content creation, virtual assistants, and more.

## Overview

Text-to-speech (TTS) models transform written text into spoken audio. They enable:

- **Voice Synthesis**: Convert any text to natural-sounding speech
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from different voice profiles
- **Speed Control**: Adjust speaking rate
- **Format Options**: Generate audio in various formats
- **Streaming**: Real-time audio generation

### Common Use Cases

- **Accessibility**: Convert text to speech for visually impaired users
- **Content Creation**: Generate voiceovers for videos and podcasts
- **Virtual Assistants**: Add voice to chatbots and AI assistants
- **Audio Books**: Convert written content to audio format
- **Language Learning**: Pronunciation examples
- **Notifications**: Voice alerts and announcements

## Voice Instructions

Control voice characteristics with prompts:

???+ example

    ```python
    import msgflux as mf

    model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

    # Add emotional tone
    response = model(
        "I'm so excited about this!",
        prompt="Speak with enthusiasm and energy"
    )

    # Control pacing
    response = model(
        "This is an important announcement.",
        prompt="Speak slowly and clearly, emphasizing each word"
    )

    # Set context
    response = model(
        "Welcome to the show!",
        prompt="Speak as a radio host, upbeat and friendly"
    )
    ```

Note: `gpt-4o-mini-tts` has native steerability — you can instruct not just *what* to say but *how* to say it.

## Streaming Audio

Generate and play audio in real-time:

???+ example

    === "Basic"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        response = model(
            "This is a long text that will be streamed as audio chunks...",
            stream=True
        )

        # Process chunks as they arrive
        for chunk in response.consume():
            if chunk is None:  # End of stream
                break
            # chunk is bytes - play or save incrementally
            process_audio_chunk(chunk)
        ```

    === "To File"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        response = model(
            "This will be streamed to a file.",
            stream=True,
            response_format="mp3"
        )

        with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
            for chunk in response.consume():
                if chunk is None:
                    break
                f.write(chunk)

        print("Audio saved to output.mp3")
        ```

    === "Together AI"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech(
            "together/canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft",
            voice="tara",
            response_format="mp3"
        )

        response = model(
            "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
            stream=True
        )

        with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
            for chunk in response.consume():
                if chunk is None:
                    break
                f.write(chunk)
        ```

    === "Playback"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import pyaudio  # pip install pyaudio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        # Setup audio playback
        p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
        stream = p.open(
            format=pyaudio.paInt16,
            channels=1,
            rate=24000,  # 24kHz for TTS
            output=True
        )

        response = model(
            "This will be played in real-time.",
            stream=True,
            response_format="pcm"
        )

        for chunk in response.consume():
            if chunk is None:
                break
            stream.write(chunk)

        stream.stop_stream()
        stream.close()
        p.terminate()
        ```

## Async Support

Generate audio asynchronously:

???+ example

    === "Basic"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        async def main():
            response = await model.acall("Hello, how are you today?", voice="nova")
            audio_path = response.consume()
            print(audio_path)

        asyncio.run(main())
        ```

    === "Streaming"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        async def stream_speech(text):
            response = await model.acall(text, stream=True)

            async for chunk in response.consume():
                if chunk is None:
                    break
                # Process chunk asynchronously
                await process_chunk(chunk)

        asyncio.run(stream_speech("Hello world"))
        ```

## Batch Processing

Generate multiple audio files:

???+ example

    ```python
    import msgflux as mf
    import msgflux.nn.functional as F

    model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="nova")

    texts = [
        "Welcome to chapter one.",
        "Welcome to chapter two.",
        "Welcome to chapter three."
    ]

    # Generate in parallel
    results = F.map_gather(
        model,
        args_list=[(text,) for text in texts]
    )

    # Save all files
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        audio_path = result.consume()
        import shutil
        shutil.copy(audio_path, f"chapter_{i+1}.opus")
    ```

## Working with Audio Files

???+ example

    === "Save"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import shutil

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        response = model("Save this audio", response_format="mp3")

        # Get temporary file path and copy to desired location
        temp_path = response.consume()
        shutil.copy(temp_path, "output.mp3")
        print("Saved to output.mp3")
        ```

    === "Play"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import subprocess

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        response = model("Play this message")
        audio_path = response.consume()

        # Play with system player
        subprocess.run(["mpv", audio_path])  # Or use "afplay" on macOS
        ```

    === "Audio Info"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        from pydub import AudioSegment

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        response = model("Get information about this audio", response_format="mp3")
        audio_path = response.consume()

        # Load with pydub
        audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(audio_path)

        print(f"Duration: {len(audio) / 1000:.2f} seconds")
        print(f"Channels: {audio.channels}")
        print(f"Frame rate: {audio.frame_rate} Hz")
        print(f"Sample width: {audio.sample_width} bytes")
        ```

## Common Patterns

???+ example

    === "Multi-Voice Narration"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        from pydub import AudioSegment

        # Create models with different voices
        narrator = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="fable")
        character1 = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="nova")
        character2 = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="onyx")

        # Generate dialogue
        narration = narrator("The story begins").consume()
        line1 = character1("Hello there!").consume()
        line2 = character2("Hi, how are you?").consume()

        # Combine audio
        combined = AudioSegment.from_file(narration)
        combined += AudioSegment.from_file(line1)
        combined += AudioSegment.from_file(line2)

        combined.export("dialogue.mp3", format="mp3")
        ```

    === "Audiobook"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        from pydub import AudioSegment

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="fable")

        chapters = [
            "Chapter 1: Once upon a time...",
            "Chapter 2: The adventure begins...",
            "Chapter 3: A challenge appears..."
        ]

        audio_segments = []
        for i, chapter_text in enumerate(chapters):
            print(f"Generating chapter {i+1}...")
            response = model(chapter_text, response_format="mp3")
            audio_segments.append(AudioSegment.from_mp3(response.consume()))

        # Combine with silence between chapters
        silence = AudioSegment.silent(duration=2000)  # 2 seconds
        combined = audio_segments[0]
        for segment in audio_segments[1:]:
            combined += silence + segment

        combined.export("audiobook.mp3", format="mp3")
        print("Audiobook created!")
        ```

    === "Language Learning"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf

        model_slow = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="nova", speed=0.7)
        model_normal = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="nova", speed=1.0)

        phrase = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

        # Slow version for learning
        slow_audio = model_slow(phrase, response_format="mp3").consume()

        # Normal speed for practice
        normal_audio = model_normal(phrase, response_format="mp3").consume()

        print(f"Slow: {slow_audio}")
        print(f"Normal: {normal_audio}")
        ```

    === "Podcast"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        from pydub import AudioSegment

        # Create hosts with different voices
        host1 = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="echo")
        host2 = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="shimmer")

        intro = host1("Welcome to our podcast!").consume()
        response1 = host2("Thanks for having me!").consume()
        discussion = host1("Let's talk about AI...").consume()

        podcast = AudioSegment.from_file(intro)
        podcast += AudioSegment.from_file(response1)
        podcast += AudioSegment.from_file(discussion)

        podcast.export("podcast.mp3", format="mp3")
        ```

## Error Handling

        audio_path = response.consume()
    except ImportError:
        print("Provider not installed")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Invalid parameters: {e}")
        # Common issues:
