# Text to Speech

The `text_to_speech` model converts text into natural-sounding spoken audio. These models enable voice generation for accessibility, content creation, virtual assistants, and more.

## ✦₊⁺ Overview

Text-to-speech (TTS) models transform written text into spoken audio. They enable:

- **Voice Synthesis**: Convert any text to natural-sounding speech
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from different voice profiles
- **Speed Control**: Adjust speaking rate
- **Format Options**: Generate audio in various formats
- **Streaming**: Real-time audio generation

### Common Use Cases

- **Accessibility**: Convert text to speech for visually impaired users
- **Content Creation**: Generate voiceovers for videos and podcasts
- **Virtual Assistants**: Add voice to chatbots and AI assistants
- **Audio Books**: Convert written content to audio format
- **Language Learning**: Pronunciation examples
- **Notifications**: Voice alerts and announcements

            voice="tara",
            response_format="mp3"
        )
        ```

## 2. **Quick Start**

???+ example

    === "Basic"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf

        # Create TTS model
        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        # Generate speech
        response = model("Hello, how are you today?")

        # Get audio file path
        audio_path = response.consume()
        print(audio_path)  # /tmp/tmpXXXXXX.opus
        ```

    === "With Voice"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech(
            "openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts",
            voice="nova",  # Female voice
            speed=1.0      # Normal speed
        )

        response = model("Welcome to our service!")
        audio_path = response.consume()
        ```

## 3. **Audio Formats**

### Format Comparison

| Format | Quality | Size | Use Case |
|--------|---------|------|----------|
| **opus** | High | Small | Streaming, real-time |
| **mp3** | Good | Medium | Universal playback |
| **aac** | High | Small | Mobile, web |
| **flac** | Lossless | Large | Archival, editing |
| **wav** | Lossless | Large | Professional audio |
| **pcm** | Raw | Largest | Audio processing |

## 4. **Voice Instructions**

Control voice characteristics with prompts:

???+ example

    ```python
    import msgflux as mf

    model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

    # Add emotional tone
    response = model(
        "I'm so excited about this!",
        prompt="Speak with enthusiasm and energy"
    )

    # Control pacing
    response = model(
        "This is an important announcement.",
        prompt="Speak slowly and clearly, emphasizing each word"
    )

    # Set context
    response = model(
        "Welcome to the show!",
        prompt="Speak as a radio host, upbeat and friendly"
    )
    ```

Note: `gpt-4o-mini-tts` has native steerability — you can instruct not just *what* to say but *how* to say it.

## 5. **Streaming Audio**

Generate and play audio in real-time:

???+ example

    === "Pull One Chunk"

        Use `next_chunk()` when your application needs to decide exactly when the next audio chunk is delivered, such as a TUI that coordinates playback with user controls:

        ```python
        import asyncio
        import msgflux as mf

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech(
            "openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts",
            stream_chunk_size=512,
        )

        async def handle():
            response = await model.acall(
                "This audio is pulled one chunk at a time.",
                stream=True,
                response_format="pcm"
            )

            while True:
                chunk = await response.next_chunk()
                if chunk is None:
                    break

                # chunk is bytes - play, buffer, or save when your app is ready
                process_audio_chunk(chunk)

        asyncio.run(handle())
        ```

        `stream_chunk_size` controls the byte size requested from the provider response when msgFlux reads streaming audio. Smaller values can make local playback controls feel more responsive, but may add Python and queue overhead. It does not pause or resume generation on the remote provider. OpenAI and Together speech requests use msgFlux's built-in HTTP transport, so they do not require the OpenAI Python SDK.

    === "Basic"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        response = model(
            "This is a long text that will be streamed as audio chunks...",
            stream=True
        )

        # consume() returns an async generator
        async def handle():
            async for chunk in response.consume():
                # chunk is bytes - play or save incrementally
                process_audio_chunk(chunk)

        asyncio.run(handle())
        ```

    === "To File"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        async def save():
            response = model(
                "This will be streamed to a file.",
                stream=True,
                response_format="mp3"
            )

            with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
                async for chunk in response.consume():
                    f.write(chunk)

            print("Audio saved to output.mp3")

        asyncio.run(save())
        ```

    === "Together AI"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech(
            "together/canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft",
            voice="tara",
            response_format="mp3"
        )

        async def save():
            response = model(
                "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
                stream=True
            )

            with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
                async for chunk in response.consume():
                    f.write(chunk)

        asyncio.run(save())
        ```

    === "Playback"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio
        import pyaudio  # pip install pyaudio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        async def play():
            p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
            stream = p.open(
                format=pyaudio.paInt16,
                channels=1,
                rate=24000,  # 24kHz for TTS
                output=True
            )

            response = model(
                "This will be played in real-time.",
                stream=True,
                response_format="pcm"
            )

            async for chunk in response.consume():
                stream.write(chunk)

            stream.stop_stream()
            stream.close()
            p.terminate()

        asyncio.run(play())
        ```

## 6. **Async Support**

Generate audio asynchronously:

???+ example

    === "Basic"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        async def main():
            response = await model.acall("Hello, how are you today?")
            audio_path = response.consume()
            print(audio_path)

        asyncio.run(main())
        ```

    === "Streaming"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import asyncio

        model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts")

        async def stream_speech(text):
            response = await model.acall(text, stream=True)

            async for chunk in response.consume():
                # Process chunk asynchronously
                await process_chunk(chunk)

        asyncio.run(stream_speech("Hello world"))
        ```

## 7. **Batch Processing**

Generate multiple audio files:

???+ example

    ```python
    import msgflux as mf
    import msgflux.nn.functional as F

    model = mf.Model.text_to_speech("openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="nova")

    texts = [
        "Welcome to chapter one.",
        "Welcome to chapter two.",
        "Welcome to chapter three."
    ]

    # Generate in parallel
    results = F.map_gather(
        model,
        args_list=[(text,) for text in texts]
    )

    # Save all files
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        audio_path = result.consume()
        import shutil
        shutil.copy(audio_path, f"chapter_{i+1}.opus")
    ```

        response = model("Save this audio", response_format="mp3")

        # Get temporary file path and copy to desired location
        temp_path = response.consume()
        shutil.copy(temp_path, "output.mp3")
        print("Saved to output.mp3")
        ```
