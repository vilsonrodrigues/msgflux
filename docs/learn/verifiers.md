# Verifiers

## LLM-as-a-Verifier

`LLMAsVerifier` is a logprob-aware verification pattern adapted from
[LLM-as-a-Verifier](https://llm-as-a-verifier.notion.site/).

Think of it as a teacher grading answers.

You give it:

- a `task`
- one or more `candidates`
- a list of `criteria`

The verifier then scores each candidate, compares them when needed, and returns
either a verdict, a winner, or a tournament ranking.

## Single Candidate

```python
# pip install msgflux
import msgflux as mf
from msgflux.generation.verifiers import LLMAsVerifier, VerificationCriterion

# mf.load_dotenv()

criterion = VerificationCriterion(
    id="correctness",
    name="Correctness",
    description="Assess whether the candidate fully answers the task.",
)

verifier = LLMAsVerifier(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    criteria=[criterion],
    n_verifications=2,
)

result = verifier(
    task="What is 2 + 2?",
    candidates={"answer": "The answer is 4."},
)

print(result.verdict)  # pass
print(result.score)    # normalized score in [0, 1]
print(result.scores)   # {"answer": ...}
```

!!! info
    `LLMAsVerifier` requests `logprobs=True` and `top_logprobs` automatically
    on the model call. If the provider returns token logprobs, the verifier
    uses them to compute the score distribution. If not, it falls back to
    parsing the emitted score from text. Set `strict_logprobs=True` to require
    logprob-based extraction.

## Pairwise Comparison

```python
result = verifier(
    task="Pick the better final answer.",
    candidates={
        "paris_answer": "The capital of France is Paris.",
        "lyon_answer": "The capital of France is Lyon.",
    },
)

print(result.verdict)  # "paris_answer", "lyon_answer", or "tie"
print(result.winner)   # winner label or None
print(result.scores)   # {"paris_answer": ..., "lyon_answer": ...}
```

Pairwise mode is the natural building block for trajectory comparison and
candidate selection.

## Round-Robin Selection

For tasks with multiple candidates, use `select_best`:

```python
tournament = verifier.select_best(
    task="Pick the best final answer.",
    candidates={
        "draft_1": "Answer one",
        "draft_2": "Answer two",
        "draft_3": "Answer three",
    },
)

print(tournament.winner)
print(tournament.ranking)
print(tournament.wins)
```

This runs pairwise comparisons across all candidates and selects the winner by
round-robin wins, using average verifier score as a tiebreaker.

## API Shape

Use `__call__` or `acall` when you want to verify `1` or `2` candidates:

```python
single = verifier(
    task="What is 2 + 2?",
    candidates={"answer": "The answer is 4."},
)

pairwise = verifier(
    task="Pick the better final answer.",
    candidates={
        "draft_1": "The answer is 4.",
        "draft_2": "The answer is 5.",
    },
)
```

Use `select_best` or `aselect_best` when you have more than `2` candidates:

```python
tournament = verifier.select_best(
    task="Pick the best final answer.",
    candidates={
        "draft_1": "The answer is 4.",
        "draft_2": "It is probably 4.",
        "draft_3": "The answer is 5.",
    },
)
```

## How It Works

The verifier does not ask the model for a vague overall judgment. It breaks the
evaluation into smaller pieces and then aggregates them.

### `criteria`

`criteria` are the grading rules.

Examples:

- `correctness`
- `completeness`
- `grounding`
- `error_signals`

Instead of asking only "is this good?", the verifier asks smaller questions
such as:

- is it correct?
- is it complete?
- is it grounded in the evidence?
- are there unresolved errors?

That makes the final result easier to control and easier to reuse across
different tasks.

### `n_verifications`

`n_verifications` controls how many times each criterion is evaluated.

If you have:

- `3` criteria
- `n_verifications=2`

the verifier runs `6` evaluations in total, then averages the repeated attempts
for each criterion.

Use this to reduce noise:

- `n_verifications=1` is the simplest setting
- larger values usually give a more stable signal

### `granularity`

`granularity` controls how many levels exist in the score scale.

```python
from msgflux.generation.verifiers import LLMAsVerifier, ScoreScale

verifier = LLMAsVerifier.answer_reranking(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    score_scale=ScoreScale.letter(granularity=20),
)
```

With `granularity=20`, the scale is `A..T`:

- `A` is best
- `T` is worst

The model does not return a floating-point score such as `0.83`. It returns a
discrete score token from the configured scale:

```text
<score>A</score>
```

In pairwise mode it returns one score token per candidate:

```text
<score_A>B</score_A>
<score_B>H</score_B>
```

Supported range:

- `2..26`

The runtime keeps the scale letter-based because letter tokens are more stable
for `logprobs` extraction than numeric labels such as `1..20`.

### `logprobs`

This is the part that makes the technique more useful than just reading the
final score token.

The verifier asks the model for:

- `logprobs=True`
- `top_logprobs=<scale size or override>`

So it can see not only the chosen score token, but also nearby alternatives.

For example, even if the model emits:

```text
<score>A</score>
```

the underlying distribution might be closer to:

- `A`: `0.70`
- `B`: `0.20`
- `C`: `0.10`

The verifier uses that distribution to compute the final normalized score in
`[0, 1]`, instead of trusting only the chosen token.

### What Gets Returned

With one candidate, the verifier returns:

- `pass`
- `fail`
- `uncertain`

With two candidates, it returns:

- the winning label
- or `tie`

With more than two candidates, `select_best(...)` runs pairwise comparisons and
returns:

- `winner`
- `ranking`
- `wins`
- `average_scores`

## Verbose Debugging

Set `verbose=True` when you want the verifier to return the final prompt and raw
model output for each attempt.

```python
verifier = LLMAsVerifier(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    criteria=[criterion],
    verbose=True,
)

result = verifier(
    task="What is 2 + 2?",
    candidates={"answer": "The answer is 4."},
)

print(result.metadata["raw_outputs"][0]["prompt"])
print(result.metadata["raw_outputs"][0]["response_text"])
```

The same data also remains available in `criteria_results[*].attempts[*]`:

```python
attempt = result.criteria_results[0].attempts[0]
print(attempt.prompt_text)
print(attempt.response_text)
```

## Custom Prompting

You can replace the default prompt with `prompt_builder`. The builder receives a
`VerificationPromptInput` containing the task, candidates, criterion,
score scale, context, and optional verifier instructions.

```python
from msgflux.generation.verifiers import (
    LLMAsVerifier,
    VerificationCriterion,
    VerificationPromptInput,
)


def build_prompt(data: VerificationPromptInput) -> str:
    label, candidate = next(iter(data.candidates.items()))
    return (
        "Evaluate the answer.\n\n"
        f"Task:\n{data.task}\n\n"
        f"Criterion:\n{data.criterion.description}\n\n"
        f"Candidate ({label}):\n{candidate}\n\n"
        f"<score>{data.score_scale.score_format}</score>"
    )


verifier = LLMAsVerifier(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    criteria=[
        VerificationCriterion(
            id="faithfulness",
            name="Faithfulness",
            description="Check whether the answer is grounded in the context.",
        )
    ],
    prompt_builder=build_prompt,
)
```

## Built-In Presets

Use a preset when you want a good default set of criteria without defining it
by hand.

Each preset still returns a normal `LLMAsVerifier`, so you can override
`criteria`, `ground_truth_note`, `extra_instructions`, `n_verifications`, and
the model request kwargs.

```python
from msgflux.generation.verifiers import LLMAsVerifier

trajectory = LLMAsVerifier.trajectory_analysis(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

reranker = LLMAsVerifier.answer_reranking(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

grounded = LLMAsVerifier.grounded_answer_verification(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

patches = LLMAsVerifier.patch_selection(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

tools = LLMAsVerifier.tool_trace_verification(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

filtering = LLMAsVerifier.synthetic_data_filtering(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

terminal = LLMAsVerifier.terminal_bench(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)

swe = LLMAsVerifier.swe_bench_verified(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
)
```

### `synthetic_data_filtering`

Use this for generated examples before adding them to datasets, evals, or
distillation corpora.

## Trajectory Formatting Helpers

For benchmark-style presets, pass the full trajectory as the candidate
evidence, not only the final answer. Two helpers are available:

- `format_terminal_trajectory(...)`
- `format_swe_bench_trajectory(...)`

Keep the task or issue description in `task`. Use the helpers to build each
candidate string from commands, outputs, patch text, and final answer.

```python
from msgflux.generation.verifiers import (
    LLMAsVerifier,
    format_terminal_trajectory,
)

candidate = format_terminal_trajectory(
    summary="Installed the binary and verified the version output.",
    metadata={"expected_output": "tool 1.2.0"},
    steps=[
        {
            "command": "cp ./tool /usr/local/bin/tool",
            "exit_code": 0,
        },
        {
            "command": "tool --version",
            "output": "tool 1.2.0",
            "exit_code": 0,
        },
    ],
    final_answer="Installation complete.",
)

verifier = LLMAsVerifier.terminal_bench(model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
result = verifier(
    task="Install the binary to /usr/local/bin/tool and verify `tool --version`.",
    candidates={"run_a": candidate},
)
```

```python
from msgflux.generation.verifiers import (
    LLMAsVerifier,
    format_swe_bench_trajectory,
)

candidate = format_swe_bench_trajectory(
    summary="Reproduced the bug, patched the parser, and reran the focused test.",
    steps=[
        {
            "command": "pytest tests/test_parser.py -q",
            "output": "1 failed, 4 passed",
            "exit_code": 1,
        },
        {
            "command": "pytest tests/test_parser.py -q",
            "output": "5 passed",
            "exit_code": 0,
        },
    ],
    patch=patch_text,
    final_answer="Patched parser and verified the focused test.",
)

verifier = LLMAsVerifier.swe_bench_verified(model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
result = verifier(
    task="Fix the parser bug described in the issue.",
    candidates={"candidate_patch": candidate},
)
```

## Best Use Cases

This technique is most useful when you need to compare, rank, or filter
candidates and the task does not already have a deterministic validator.

### Trajectory Selection

This is the most natural fit.

- compare alternative reasoning trajectories
- compare multiple agent runs for the same task
- select the strongest final trajectory before returning it

### Candidate Reranking

Use it to rerank multiple drafts of the same task.

- final answers
- summaries
- plans
- retrieval-grounded responses

### Patch Selection

It works well for code generation when you want to compare multiple candidate
patches before running deeper validation.

- choose the patch that best satisfies the task
- prefer the patch that looks more correct or complete
- filter obviously weak candidates before tests or deeper validation

### Tool-Using Agent Verification

Use it to check whether a final answer is consistent with tool results and the
execution trace.

- verify completion quality
- verify grounding in tool outputs
- detect unresolved errors hidden by a confident final answer

### Synthetic Data Filtering

Use it to filter generated examples before storing them in datasets, evals, or
distillation corpora.

- reject inconsistent examples
- reject weak labels
- keep only high-confidence candidates

### Optimizer Feedback

Use it as a reusable feedback signal for future optimizer integrations.

- provide a reusable reward signal
- score prompt variants
- compare sampled candidates during search or optimization

## When Not to Use

Prefer deterministic validation when the task already has a deterministic check.

- exact-match tasks
- schema validation
- unit tests
- regex-based extraction checks
- simple business rules
