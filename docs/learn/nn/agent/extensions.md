# Agent Extensions

An `AgentExtension` packages hooks and tools behind one removable capability.
Use a plain `Hook` for one interception point; use an extension when a feature
owns several pieces that should be installed and removed together.

## Define An Extension

```python
from dataclasses import replace

import msgflux.nn as nn
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook, ModelContext


class TenantContext(nn.AgentExtension):
    def __init__(self, tenant_client):
        super().__init__("tenant_context")
        self.tenant_client = tenant_client

    async def add_context(self, ctx: ModelContext):
        profile = await self.tenant_client.get_profile(ctx.vars["tenant_id"])
        return replace(
            ctx,
            system_prompt=(
                f"{ctx.system_prompt}\n\nTenant profile: {profile}".strip()
            ),
        )

    def hooks(self):
        return (
            Hook(event="transform_system_prompt", handler=self.add_context),
        )
```

Install it when constructing the Agent:

```python
agent = nn.Agent(
    name="support",
    model=model,
    extensions=[TenantContext(tenant_client)],
)

response = await agent.acall(
    "Summarize the open requests.",
    vars={"tenant_id": "acme"},
)
```

Async handlers are awaited in registration order. The active
`ExecutionScope.abort_signal` is observed while a handler waits, so aborting a
run cancels its in-flight handler instead of waiting for network I/O to finish.

## Add Tools

Return ordinary msgFlux tools from `tools()`:

```python
class CustomerActions(nn.AgentExtension):
    def __init__(self, client):
        super().__init__("customer_actions")
        self.client = client

    def tools(self):
        async def get_customer(customer_id: str) -> dict:
            """Get a customer by id."""
            return await self.client.get_customer(customer_id)

        return (get_customer,)
```

The Agent registers the tool in its existing `ToolLibrary`, preserving the
normal schema, injection, telemetry, tool events, and abort behavior.

## Register And Remove

Registration returns an ownership handle:

```python
handle = agent.register_extension(
    "customer_actions",
    CustomerActions(client),
)

handle.remove()
```

`remove()` disables extension hooks for new runs immediately. A run that
already started keeps the extension snapshot it began with, and cleanup waits
until those runs finish. Tools contributed through the Agent's `ToolLibrary`
remain registered until that cleanup boundary; a concurrent run started during
removal may still observe them. Configure extensions before serving concurrent
requests when the tool surface must remain fixed.

Use async removal only when the extension itself owns asynchronous cleanup:

```python
await handle.aremove()
```

Registration and removal are intentionally not context managers. Keep the
handle when ownership is temporary, or remove by name with
`agent.remove_extension("customer_actions")`.

## Hooks And Extensions

`hooks=` remains a public low-level API. Extensions compose that API; they do
not replace it. This separation keeps stable lifecycle boundaries reusable by
application hooks, guards, skills, and conversation compaction.

Agent-specific lifecycle payloads derive from `AgentContext`, which carries the
active execution `scope` and runtime `vars`. `ModelContext` adds the rendered
`prompt` and a read-only active `tool_catalog`; `OutputContext` adds the settled
presentation-only `output`. The catalog is available so prompt extensions can
describe the active tools, but this hook does not change the request tool
surface. Return a replaced dataclass to modify supported fields. Avoid storing
per-run data on the extension instance because one Agent may execute multiple
threads concurrently.

Extensions can intercept the request at progressively narrower boundaries:

- `transform_context` changes conversation messages through
  `ConversationContext`.
- `transform_notifications` filters pending non-control notifications.
- `transform_tool_catalog` changes the logical tools available to the request.
- `transform_system_prompt` changes only the rendered prompt.
- `before_request` receives the final provider-neutral `ModelRequestContext`.
- `after_response` receives a settled `ModelResponseContext`.
- `resolve_tool_feedback` receives canonical tool intents and outcomes before
  the Agent either continues the model loop or returns.
- `before_run_end` and `after_run_end` surround the final durable checkpoint.

Use the earliest boundary that owns the information being changed. For
example, filtering tools in `before_request` is possible but makes prompt
guidance inconsistent; `transform_tool_catalog` updates both surfaces together.

## Built-In Prompt Extensions

Optional prompt capabilities use the same removable contract as application
extensions. Add `CurrentDateExtension` when the model needs the current UTC
date; tool usage guidance is supplied by `ToolUsageGuidanceExtension`. Both
append their sections through `transform_system_prompt`, leaving the Agent's
canonical `system_prompt` unchanged. Passing `examples=` installs the same kind
of removable capability through `FewShotExamplesExtension`.

You can install or replace them explicitly:

```python
agent = nn.Agent(
    name="support",
    model=model,
    extensions=[
        nn.CurrentDateExtension(),
        nn.ToolUsageGuidanceExtension(),
    ],
)
```

If an explicitly supplied extension uses one of those names, the Agent does not
also install the matching built-in. Their names are `current_date` and
`tool_usage_guidance`, so they can be removed like any other extension.

## Conversation Compaction

`CompactionExtension` is opt-in. It contributes a `before_compaction` hook that
compares the Model's input-token estimate with `CompactionPolicy`, then approves
or skips creation of a complete context view. The Agent owns the completed-turn
boundary and checkpoint; the Model owns token counting and provider-specific
compaction.

```python
agent = nn.Agent(
    name="support",
    model=model,
    extensions=[
        nn.CompactionExtension(
            nn.CompactionPolicy(trigger_ratio=0.8)
        )
    ],
)
```

See [Conversation Compaction](compaction.md) for threshold configuration,
portable versus provider views, replay behavior, and execution events.

## Tool Feedback Extensions

After the ToolLibrary returns canonical outcomes, the Agent runs
`resolve_tool_feedback`. The default action is `"continue"`, which sends the
outcomes back to the Model. `DefaultToolFeedbackExtension` is installed by
default under the name `tool_feedback`; it converts `direct`, `handoff`, and
`call_as_response` feedback into an Agent return value.

The first extension that returns `action="return"` ends the feedback chain.
Handlers therefore run sequentially and cannot overwrite an earlier return
decision. A model response mixing different return modes is rejected because
there is no unambiguous owner for the final output.

Replace the built-in by supplying an extension with the same name. This example
adds an application-specific `approval` feedback mode:

```python
from dataclasses import replace

import msgflux.nn as nn
from msgflux.tools.config import tool_config
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook, ToolFeedbackContext


class ApprovalFeedback(nn.AgentExtension):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("tool_feedback")

    async def resolve(self, ctx: ToolFeedbackContext):
        modes = {outcome.feedback.name for outcome in ctx.outcomes}
        if modes == {"approval"}:
            return replace(
                ctx,
                action="return",
                output={"status": "awaiting_approval"},
            )
        return ctx

    def hooks(self):
        return (Hook(event="resolve_tool_feedback", handler=self.resolve),)


@tool_config(feedback="approval")
def request_deployment(environment: str) -> str:
    """Prepare a deployment request for review."""
    return f"deployment:{environment}"


agent = nn.Agent(
    name="operator",
    model=model,
    tools=[request_deployment],
    extensions=[ApprovalFeedback()],
)
```

Replacing `tool_feedback` also removes the standard return behavior. If a
custom extension should only add a new mode, give it another name and install
it alongside `DefaultToolFeedbackExtension`.

Use `self.state()` when hooks in the same run need to share temporary data:

```python
class ContextAnalysis(nn.AgentExtension):
    def __init__(self, analyzer):
        super().__init__("context_analysis")
        self.analyzer = analyzer

    async def analyze(self, event):
        self.state()["analysis"] = await self.analyzer.acall(event.message)
        return event
```

The state is namespaced by Agent and extension, inherited by nested work in the
same execution context, and discarded when the run ends. It is not persisted in
checkpoints and must not hold durable conversation state.
