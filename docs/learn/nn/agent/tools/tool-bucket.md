# Tool Bucket

`ToolBucket` groups several logical tools behind one callable tool. The model
sees only the bucket schema. At runtime, a scoped handle redirects the chosen
call through `ToolLibrary`, preserving local/MCP wrappers, retries, runtime
injection, errors, and telemetry.

This is the common routing primitive behind two built-ins:

| Built-in | Captures | Public surface |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| [`AgentTool`](agent-tool.md) | Agents with `tool_kind="agent"` | `agent(name, message)` |
| [`ToolSearchTool`](tool-search.md) | Tools with `defer_loading=True` | `tool_search(...)` |

A bucket is useful when a large set of implementations share one stable entry
point. It reduces schema count without discarding the identity, configuration,
or implementation of the captured tools.

## Define And Register A Bucket

A bucket defines a public name and schema, plus a `capture` mapping. In this
example, both catalog and order tools become targets of one
`operations(name, query)` tool:

```python
import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn
from msgflux.tools import ToolBucket


@mf.tool_config(tool_kind="catalog")
def find_product(query: str) -> str:
    """Find products by name or SKU."""
    return f"Product match: {query}"


@mf.tool_config(tool_kind="orders")
def find_order(query: str) -> str:
    """Find orders by customer or order ID."""
    return f"Order match: {query}"


class OperationsTool(ToolBucket):
    """Dispatch a query to one operations tool."""

    name = "operations"
    capture = {
        "tool_kind": "catalog|orders",
        "defer_loading": False,
    }
    tool_config = {"runtime_inputs": ["handle"]}
    annotations = {
        "name": str,
        "query": str,
        "handle": mf.Hidden,
        "return": str,
    }

    def __call__(self, name: str, query: str, *, handle) -> str:
        return handle(name, query=query)

    async def acall(self, name: str, query: str, *, handle) -> str:
        return await handle.acall(name, query=query)


library = nn.ToolLibrary(
    name="store",
    tools=[find_product, OperationsTool(), find_order],
)

print(library.get_tool_names())
# ["operations"]
```

Registration order is deliberately irrelevant. `ToolLibrary` routes a new
matching tool into an existing bucket, and a newly registered bucket captures
matching tools already in the library. Captured tools are removed from the
top-level callable surface. A bucket may read their metadata to build its
presentation, but should execute them only through `handle(...)` or
`handle.acall(...)`. The handle carries the original `messages` and `vars`
objects. The selected child's own injection policy decides whether messages are
shared or copied; agent children receive an isolated history, while ordinary
tools retain reference semantics. Add and remove tools through the library or
its handle so capture rules and presentation refresh remain correct.

## Capture Rules

`capture` matches normalized `tool_config` fields by equality. The special
`tool_kind` value can contain several alternatives separated by `|`:

```python
capture = {"tool_kind": "catalog|orders", "defer_loading": False}
```

All fields must match. In the example, a catalog tool with
`defer_loading=True` does not enter `OperationsTool`; it is captured by tool
search instead. This gives the catalog one clear owner.

The library validates ownership before mutating its state:

- two buckets whose capture rules can match the same tool are rejected;
- duplicate captured names are rejected;
- a bucket cannot be removed while it still owns tools;
- empty or duplicate `tool_kind` alternatives are rejected;
- an executable bucket rejects captured tools configured with model-loop
  behavior: `background`, `allow_background`, `detached`, `call_as_response`,
  `return_direct`, or `handoff`.

The last rule keeps ownership explicit. The public bucket controls whether its
model-visible call runs in the background, returns directly, or changes the
tool loop. A hidden child retains its own wrapper behavior—argument restoration,
runtime injection, retry, errors, and telemetry—but cannot independently change
the parent loop. Configure model-loop options on the bucket itself.

A specialized catalog bucket may override `validate_capture`. The built-in
`ToolSearchTool` does this because it stores deferred tool metadata and later
exposes the selected tool as a normal public call; it does not proxy-execute
that child behind `tool_search(...)`.

## Refreshing The Public Tool

`ToolBucket.add(...)` and `remove(...)` call `refresh()`. Override that hook
when the public description or usage guidance depends on the current contents:

```python
class NamedOperationsTool(OperationsTool):
    def refresh(self) -> None:
        names = ", ".join(sorted(self.tools)) or "none"
        self.description = f"Dispatch an operations query. Available: {names}."
```

After the hook runs, `ToolLibrary` copies the updated description and
`usage_guidance` to the model-facing bucket tool. `AgentTool` uses this to keep
its compact agent list current.

## Membership And Concurrency

Bucket membership is library state. Static registration and
`handle.add(tool)` therefore affect every concurrent call that shares the same
`ToolLibrary`. Use separate libraries when different tenants truly have
different allowed implementations.

Deferred activation is the exception: tool search stores active names in each
thread's `ChatMessages`, so concurrent threads may expose different deferred
subsets without mutating shared bucket membership.

## ToolBucket Versus ToolBackground

`ToolBucket` presents several captured implementations through one dispatcher.
`ToolBackground` instead manages independently callable task-control tools
according to the capabilities declared by background sources. Use a bucket to
stabilize one public schema; use background capabilities when each task
operation must remain directly callable.
