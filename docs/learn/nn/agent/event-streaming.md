# Execution Event Streaming

Use an execution event stream when an application needs the whole agent
lifecycle rather than only the final answer. Assistant content, model requests,
tool activity, failures, and run boundaries share one ordered stream.

## Usage

`stream_events()` is an async iterator. It runs the Agent and yields events as
they occur. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment, then consume the events
inside an async function. This example defines a minimal Agent, prints streamed
text, and captures the final output and run outcome. The complete Agent
response is included in `message.end`; the following `run.end` closes the
execution without repeating that potentially large content:

```python
import asyncio

import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="incident_analyst",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion(
        "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
        api_mode="responses",
    ),
    config={"stream": True},
)

incident_log = """\
09:02 - Scanner A stopped sending inventory updates.
09:07 - Orders continued reserving stock from the last known snapshot.
09:18 - Scanner A was restarted and queued updates began arriving.
09:23 - Two orders had overlapping reservations for SKU-1842.
09:31 - New reservations for SKU-1842 were paused.
"""


async def main() -> None:
    final_output = None
    outcome = None

    task = (
        "Summarize the failure sequence, customer impact, and immediate next "
        f"action from this incident log:\n\n{incident_log}"
    )

    async for event in agent.stream_events(task):
        if event.type == "message.delta":
            print(event.data["delta"], end="", flush=True)
        elif event.type == "message.end":
            final_output = event.data["content"]
        elif event.type == "run.end":
            outcome = event.data["outcome"]

    print(f"\n\noutcome={outcome}")
    print(f"final_output={final_output}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

`stream_events()` and `config={"stream": True}` control different layers.
`stream_events()` exposes Agent lifecycle events; the config enables incremental
output from the model. Without `stream=True`, the lifecycle stream still emits
events such as `model.request`, `message.end`, and `run.end`, but it has no
model chunks from which to produce `message.delta`.

When the Agent acknowledges queued inbox notifications, the stream includes a
`notification.drain` event. Without checkpointing, acknowledgement follows
successful delivery; with checkpointing, it follows the durable checkpoint
commit. Its data contains the number of notifications and their IDs; notification
content is not copied into the event:

```python
async for event in agent.stream_events("Continue the task"):
    if event.type == "notification.drain":
        print(event.data["count"], event.data["notification_ids"])
```

This example lets a client observe acknowledged inbox delivery without
exposing notification payloads. If delivery or checkpointing fails before
acknowledgement, the event is not emitted and the notifications remain
available for replay.

## Watching An Existing Thread

`stream_events()` starts and owns one execution. Use `watch(thread_id)` when a
UI, websocket, or worker needs to attach to a thread that may already be
running:

```python
import asyncio

import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="incident_analyst",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion(
        "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
        api_mode="responses",
    ),
    config={"stream": True},
)

incident_log = """\
09:02 - Scanner A stopped sending inventory updates.
09:07 - Orders continued reserving stock from the last known snapshot.
09:18 - Scanner A was restarted and queued updates began arriving.
09:23 - Two orders had overlapping reservations for SKU-1842.
09:31 - New reservations for SKU-1842 were paused.
"""


def render_snapshot(snapshot) -> None:
    """Render state that existed before the live subscription began."""
    print(f"watching thread={snapshot.thread_id}")

    if snapshot.streaming_message:
        print(snapshot.streaming_message, end="", flush=True)

    for tool in snapshot.running_tools:
        print(f"\nalready running tool={tool.tool_name}")


def update_ui(event) -> None:
    """Apply one live event to this example's terminal UI."""
    if event.type == "message.delta":
        print(event.data["delta"], end="", flush=True)
    elif event.type == "tool.start":
        print(f"\nrunning tool={event.data['tool_name']}")


async def main() -> None:
    thread_id = "warehouse-incident-42"
    task = (
        "Explain why the overlapping reservations require reconciliation and "
        f"recommend the immediate operational action from this log:\n\n{incident_log}"
    )
    run = asyncio.create_task(
        agent.acall(
            task,
            scope=mf.ExecutionScope(thread_id=thread_id),
        )
    )

    async with agent.watch(thread_id) as watcher:
        render_snapshot(watcher.snapshot)

        async for event in watcher:
            update_ui(event)
            if event.type in {"run.end", "run.error"}:
                break

    await run


asyncio.run(main())
```

Entering the async context atomically captures a `ThreadSnapshot` and subscribes
to later events. Events produced after the capture are buffered until iteration
starts, so there is no gap between reading the snapshot and receiving live
updates.

The snapshot contains:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `messages` | Latest durable `ChatMessages` when the Agent has a checkpoint store; otherwise `None` |
| `active_runs` | All process-local runs currently active in the thread, including nested agents |
| `running_tools` | Tool calls that started but have not settled |
| `background_tasks` | Background tasks that were dispatched but have not settled |
| `active_run` | Convenience access to the most recently started active run |
| `streaming_message` | Convenience access to that run's accumulated assistant output |

Each active-run snapshot also carries accumulated clear-text reasoning and
reasoning summaries when the provider exposes them. This lets a reconnecting UI
render the partial state first and then apply only the new deltas.

Agent executions publish to the process-local event hub even when
`stream_events()` is not active. Without watchers, the runtime maintains only
the state needed for a live snapshot: it does not allocate subscriber queues or
retain a replayable event log. Once runs, tools, and background tasks settle,
that live projection is discarded. Durable conversation recovery continues to
come from the checkpoint store.

`watch()` observes but does not start, resume, or cancel a run. Leaving its
context only unsubscribes that watcher. It also does not replay events that
occurred before the snapshot; their current effects are represented by the
snapshot instead.

When the model itself streams, the event iterator owns and consumes that model
stream. Do not separately consume a `ModelStreamResponse`: the content is
already delivered through `message.delta`, reasoning through
`reasoning.delta`, provider summaries through `reasoning_summary.delta`, and
the complete output through `message.end`.

Reasoning events preserve their order relative to visible output. They are
also emitted for model calls that lead to a tool invocation, before
`tool.start`, rather than being hidden inside the Agent's tool loop:

```text
model.request
reasoning_summary.delta
model.response
tool.start
tool.end
model.request
reasoning_summary.delta
message.delta
model.response
```

Providers that expose clear-text reasoning produce `reasoning.delta`. OpenAI
Responses produces `reasoning_summary.delta`; its opaque reasoning state is
retained for same-provider replay but is not presented as chain-of-thought. A
non-streaming model response emits its available reasoning or summary as one
delta before `model.response`.

## Event Shape

Every `ExecutionEvent` includes:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Stable lifecycle event name |
| `timestamp` | UTC ISO 8601 emission time |
| `data` | Event-specific payload |
| `run_id` | Current run identity |
| `source_path` | Nested `type:name` identities from the observed root to the emitter |

Consume events in iterator order. Live event ordinals are not persisted or
exposed; a future durable event log would own a separate storage sequence.
Timestamps are useful for diagnostics but should not be used to reorder events.

`run.start` carries the less frequently changing execution context in its
`data`: `thread_id`, `namespace`, `root_run_id`, and `parent_run_id` for a
child operation when one exists. Foreground subagents may participate in the
same logical run as their caller; their nested `source_path` distinguishes
them. All following events remain correlatable through `run_id` and
`source_path` without repeating context on every token delta.

## Core Events

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run.start` | Execution was accepted |
| `turn.start` | An agent turn started |
| `model.request` | A request is being sent to a model |
| `model.response` | The model response settled; includes compact token usage and timing when available |
| `message.start` | Assistant output presentation started |
| `message.delta` | Assistant content chunk |
| `commentary.delta` | User-visible intermediate assistant update, distinct from final content and reasoning |
| `reasoning.delta` | Reasoning content chunk, when exposed by the provider |
| `reasoning_summary.delta` | Provider reasoning-summary chunk |
| `message.end` | Complete assistant output |
| `tool.start` | A validated local tool call or an observed provider search is starting |
| `tool.blocked` | A tool policy rejected the call before execution; includes the public arguments and reason |
| `tool.update` | Intermediate tool progress |
| `tool.end` | Tool execution completed or failed |
| `tools.updated` | Deferred tool schemas were loaded locally or discovered through the provider |
| `task.start` | A background task was dispatched; tool dispatch includes `tool_call_id` and public `arguments` for the launch card |
| `task.update` | Background task status or progress changed |
| `task.end` | A background task completed, failed, paused, or was interrupted |
| `compaction.start` | Context compaction started after the threshold policy approved it |
| `compaction.end` | Compaction completed or failed; includes compact usage when available but never the context view |
| `turn.end` | The turn reached a terminal boundary; it has no output payload |
| `run.end` | The run completed and reports its outcome |
| `run.error` | Execution failed; the iterator raises after this event |

`tool.start` and `tool.end` share the same `tool_call_id`, so clients can pair
the validated call with its settled outcome. A successful `tool.end` includes
`result`; a failed one includes `error`. The result in the event is a snapshot
converted with `msgspec.to_builtins()` when possible, with a string fallback
for values that cannot be converted. This conversion applies only to the event
payload; the normal tool execution return path continues with `outcome.result`.
For example, a tool may return a `ShellResult` instance while event consumers
see its built-in mapping and can render command statuses, stdout, and stderr
without a custom encoder.

## Tool Discovery

Portable `tool_search` calls emit the usual `tool.start` and `tool.end` events.
Selecting deferred tools also emits `tools.updated` after the thread's loading
state changes. Re-selecting already loaded tools does not emit another update.
Searching without selecting does not change the available schemas.

OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex also expose provider search items through
`tool.start`, optional `tool.update` for completed arguments, and `tool.end`.
These events have `tool_name="tool_search"`, a shared `tool_call_id`,
`execution="provider"`, `provider`, and `api_mode`. The native protocol items
remain in conversation history for replay. Observing them does not dispatch a
local tool. A failed or interrupted search ends with an `error` and does not
report tools as loaded.

A successful provider search reports names in `tools.updated` and in the
`tool.end` result as `{"loaded_tools": [...]}`. Namespace tools use qualified
names such as `crm.lookup`. Full parameter schemas are not copied into events.
Provider loading describes native discovery; it does not mutate the portable
catalog's loading state. These events add visibility without changing request
schemas or cache behavior.

```python
async for event in agent.stream_events("Find a tool to fetch a web page"):
    if event.type == "tools.updated":
        origin = event.data["execution"]  # "client" or "provider"
        print(origin, event.data["loaded_tools"])
    elif event.type == "tool.end" and event.data["tool_name"] == "tool_search":
        print("Search finished:", event.data.get("error") or event.data["result"])
```

This example displays loading changes and the search outcome. Local loading
updates include `catalog_id`; provider updates include `tool_call_id` for
association with the search. Both ordinary and streamed model responses expose
these execution events. Streamed providers preserve their order relative to
assistant deltas. Direct model consumers can inspect `ModelResponse.events` or
iterate `ModelStreamResponse.consume_events()` to observe native discovery.


## Model Metrics

`model.response` is emitted once for every LM request. For a streamed model
response, it arrives after the model's content deltas have been drained, when
terminal usage and timing are available:

```python
import asyncio

import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="incident_analyst",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion(
        "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
        api_mode="responses",
    ),
    config={"stream": True},
)

incident_log = """\
09:02 - Scanner A stopped sending inventory updates.
09:07 - Orders continued reserving stock from the last known snapshot.
09:18 - Scanner A was restarted and queued updates began arriving.
09:23 - Two orders had overlapping reservations for SKU-1842.
09:31 - New reservations for SKU-1842 were paused.
"""


async def main() -> None:
    task = (
        "Summarize the failure sequence, customer impact, and immediate next "
        f"action from this incident log:\n\n{incident_log}"
    )

    async for event in agent.stream_events(task):
        if event.type == "model.response":
            usage = event.data.get("usage", {})
            timing = event.data.get("timing", {})

            print("input tokens:", usage.get("input_tokens"))
            print("output tokens:", usage.get("output_tokens"))
            print("cached input tokens:", usage.get("cached_input_tokens"))
            print("latency (ms):", timing.get("latency_ms"))
            print("TTFT (ms):", timing.get("ttft_ms"))


asyncio.run(main())
```

The payload is intentionally compact. `usage` contains `input_tokens`,
`output_tokens`, and `cached_input_tokens` when reported; provider-native raw
usage, derived totals, and cache percentages are omitted. `timing` contains
`source`, `latency_ms`, and streaming `ttft_ms` when available.

Metrics stay on their individual `model.response` events instead of being
summed into `run.end`. This keeps multi-step tool loops and nested agents
auditable: each model call retains its own `run_id` and `source_path`, and a
consumer can aggregate only the calls relevant to its view.

Closing an event iterator early requests cancellation through the execution's
abort signal. Async execution is also cancelled locally so an abandoned client
does not retain ownership of the stream.

## Complete-Output Transformations

For Agents, a `Hook(event="transform_output", ...)` receives an `OutputContext`
with `output`, runtime `vars`, and the execution `scope`. Replacing `ctx.output`
changes the value presented to the caller without changing the canonical
assistant message stored in history. If the model streams tokens, the event
iterator accumulates assistant content and sets
`message.start.data["buffered"]` to `True`. It then emits the transformed value
once in `message.end`; raw assistant deltas are not exposed.

Reasoning, tool, and progress events are independent and continue to arrive
while assistant content is buffered. Reasoning and summaries are never passed
through `transform_output`.

### Stream completion and terminal hooks

An Agent stream owns its terminal checkpoint. When the provider closes the
`ModelStreamResponse`, the runtime first invokes `before_run_end`, persists the
settled conversation, and then invokes `after_run_end`. The same ordering is
used by synchronous and asynchronous Agent calls. A consumer that closes
`stream_events()` also waits for the execution task to finish its cancellation
cleanup, so the checkpoint is not left in the temporary `streaming` state.

See [Canonical Responses vs. Presented Output](hooks.md#canonical-responses-vs-presented-output)
for a complete example that replaces an artifact reference in the presented
event output while preserving the original reference in `ChatMessages`.

For bounded incremental expansion, install `ArtifactExtension` with an
`ArtifactRegistry`:

```python
from msgflux.nn import Agent, ArtifactExtension, ArtifactRegistry

registry = ArtifactRegistry()
registry.register("large report contents", artifact_id="report-42")
agent = Agent(
    name="reporter",
    model=model,
    extensions=[ArtifactExtension(registry)],
    config={"stream": True},
)
```

The model can emit `{{artifact:report-42}}`. Checkpoints keep that marker,
while `message.delta` events expose the registered content after the marker is
complete. Unknown or incomplete markers remain literal. Registry IDs are
logical immutable IDs, and inserted content is not scanned recursively.

## Optional Pending-Event Limits

Direct streams and thread watchers accept an independent `event_buffer_limit`.
The default `None` preserves unlimited delivery; a positive integer limits the
number of pending events, including events published by worker threads before
the event loop can process wakeups. This is a delivery limit, not a tool/model
argument, checkpoint setting or permission.

```python
from msgflux.exceptions import EventBufferOverflowError

try:
    async for event in agent.stream_events(
        "Inspect the workspace", scope=scope, event_buffer_limit=1024,
    ):
        render_event(event)
except EventBufferOverflowError as error:
    show_delivery_incomplete(error.limit)
```

Here `render_event` and `show_delivery_incomplete` are application callbacks.
On overflow the buffer closes and discards its incomplete queued tail; iteration
raises explicitly instead of silently presenting a truncated response as complete.
The producer is not blocked. Once the direct consumer observes the error, stream
cleanup cancels and awaits an execution that is still active. Work may already
have completed: this is not rollback, and the checkpoint can already be terminal.
An idle consumer does not automatically cancel its producer at the instant of
overflow. Always close abandoned iterators; inspect durable state before retrying
anything with external effects.

```python
try:
    async with agent.watch(thread_id, event_buffer_limit=512) as watcher:
        render_snapshot(watcher.snapshot)
        async for event in watcher:
            render_event(event)
except EventBufferOverflowError:
    show_reconnect_required()
```

In this example an overflowing watcher unsubscribes without cancelling the Agent
or other observers. Open a new watcher to obtain a fresh snapshot and future
events; this does not replay every missed live delta. The exception is emitted
once, then that watcher is exhausted. Limits must be positive integers (not bool);
zero is rejected rather than interpreted as unlimited.

Wakeups are coalesced so a burst does not schedule one callback per event. The
limit does **not** bound bytes per event, provider buffers, live projection text,
artifact expansion, checkpoints or total process memory. A single event can be
large. Use payload/resource policies separately; these limits are not backpressure
and do not establish any sandbox guarantee.

### Measuring Retention Before Choosing Limits

The repository includes an offline synthetic benchmark:

```bash
uv run python scripts/benchmark_event_memory.py --events 20000 --payload-bytes 1024 --limit 256
```

It reports JSON measurements for unlimited and bounded delivery queues, one
oversized tool-result event, live text projection, and a reconnect snapshot.
Each scenario emits the same total ASCII payload volume. Payloads are allocated
inside measurement, and queues/projections are cleaned up between scenarios.
Increase `--events` or `--payload-bytes` carefully: unlimited cases intentionally
retain their complete payloads.

`retained_python_bytes` measures Python allocations still alive after publishing;
`peak_python_bytes` includes temporary allocations, and
`after_cleanup_python_bytes` samples after draining delivery and releasing the
snapshot. These are `tracemalloc` measurements, not process RSS, serialized
network traffic, model tokens or a total Agent memory budget. Timing includes
tracing overhead. The synthetic burst intentionally prevents consumer drainage
during publication; it is not a representative UI latency benchmark.

Use the oversized-event and live-projection cases to check why a pending-event
count alone cannot establish a byte budget. This script does not introduce output
truncation, file spooling or new default limits.

When a reconnect snapshot joins homogeneous text or byte deltas, the live
projection consolidates its fragments into that immutable value. Reconnects
without new deltas reuse it; previously returned snapshots remain unchanged.
This avoids retaining both the joined text and its fragments in the projection,
but queued events or snapshots held by the application can still retain older
values. It is an allocation optimization, not a maximum response size.

## Event Isolation

For tools using `ToolOutputOffloadExtension`, a large final output is represented
by a structured reference and limited preview, including Shell stdout/stderr.
Use `get_tool_result_reference(event.data.get("result"))` on `tool.end` to find
the full result without parsing text. See
[complete-output retrieval](resources.md#retrieve-complete-output-from-an-event)
for authorized, chunked delivery to a UI. This does not automatically expand
events or intercept custom progress events emitted inside a tool.

Each direct `stream_events()` call owns an independent delivery channel.
Concurrent calls therefore do not receive each other's events through those
iterators. The process-local hub additionally routes events by `thread_id`, so a
thread watcher intentionally sees every run, foreground nested execution, and
background task belonging to that thread. Use `run_id` and `source_path` to
separate the root Agent, ToolLibrary, called tool, and subagent while retaining
delivery order.

A detached background task can outlive the root `stream_events()` iterator. A
thread watcher continues receiving its `task.update`, nested Agent, tool, and
terminal events after that root iterator closes.

The built-in hub is process-local. It covers concurrent Agents and background
workers in the same Python process, but it is not a distributed broker and does
not survive a process restart. After a restart, `watch()` restores the durable
conversation snapshot and observes only newly produced live events. Applications
running multiple worker processes need to route one thread to one process or
bridge events through their own broker.

## Live OpenAI Validation

The repository includes a paid integration script for the Responses protocol:

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_openai_event_streaming.py
```

It loads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`, uses `store=False`, and validates basic
token streaming, complete-output transformation, a local tool loop, and a
foreground AgentTool delegation. The `reasoning` scenario also verifies that
OpenAI Responses summaries precede visible output. Use `--scenario basic`,
`--scenario reasoning`, `--scenario transform`, `--scenario tool`, or
`--scenario nested` to run one case.
