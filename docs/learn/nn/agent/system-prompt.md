# System Prompt Components

The system prompt is composed of 6 components:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **system_message** | Agent behavior and role | "You are an agent specialist in..." |
| **instructions** | What the agent should do | "You MUST respond to the user..." |
| **expected_output** | Format of the response | "Your answer must be concise..." |
| **examples** | Input/output examples | Examples of reasoning and outputs |
| **system_extra_message** | Additional system context | Extra instructions or constraints |
| **include_date** | Include current date | Adds "Weekday, Month DD, YYYY" |

All components are assembled using a **system prompt template**, that can be customized via `templates={"system": "..."}`. By default, the template concatenates all defined components in a structured format using XML tags.

    ```python
    # pip install msgflux[openai]

    import msgflux.nn as nn

    # mf.set_envs(OPENAI_API_KEY="...")

    class BusinessAgent(nn.Agent):

        system_message = """

        """
        instructions = """
        When given a company description, identify potential needs,
        suggest an outreach strategy, and provide a value proposition.
        """
        expected_output = """
        Respond in three bullet points:
        - Identified Needs
        - Outreach Strategy
        - Value Proposition
        """
        system_extra_message = """
        Ensure recommendations align with ethical sales practices.
        """
        config = {"include_date": True, "verbose": True}

    agent = BusinessAgent()
    print(agent.get_system_prompt())
    ```

    Expected Output:

    ```bash
    <developer_note>
    <system_message>

    <expected_output>

        Respond in three bullet points:
        - Identified Needs

## Examples

**[In-Context Learning (ICL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)** is a technique where language models learn to perform tasks by observing examples provided directly in the prompt, without any parameter updates. This allows models to generalize from just a few demonstrations.

**Few-Shot Learning** refers to providing a small number of input-output examples that guide the model's behavior. These examples act as implicit instructions, showing the model the expected format, reasoning style, and output structure.

Benefits of using examples:

- **Format consistency**: The model mimics the structure of your examples
- **Implicit instructions**: Complex behaviors can be demonstrated rather than explained
- **Reasoning patterns**: Show chain-of-thought reasoning for the model to follow
- **Domain adaptation**: Tailor responses to your specific use case

There are three ways to pass examples to an Agent:
