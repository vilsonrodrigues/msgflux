# Hooks & Guards

Hooks are the primary mechanism for intercepting and validating data flowing through Modules. The `Hook` base class provides the interface, and `Guard` is a built-in hook for input/output validation. Hooks can target a stable lifecycle event, the module execution boundary (`forward`), or a specific method on the module.

## Lifecycle Hooks

Lifecycle hooks attach to a named execution boundary instead of a Python method.
This keeps extensions independent from internal method names and allows the same
hook to work in synchronous and asynchronous execution.

```python
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook


def expand_references(output):
    return output.replace("artifact://report", "the complete report")


output_hook = Hook(
    event="transform_output",
    handler=expand_references,
)
```

Pass the hook through the module's `hooks` argument. When the module reaches
`transform_output`, the handler receives the current payload. Returning a value
replaces the payload for the next handler; returning `None` leaves it unchanged.
Handlers run in registration order.

The Agent currently exposes these lifecycle boundaries:

| Event | Payload | Replacement behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `before_run` | `BeforeRun` | May replace the message or call arguments before a fresh run is prepared. |
| `before_resume` | `BeforeResume` | Observes restored durable state; its return value does not replace that state. |
| `transform_context` | `ChatMessages` | May replace the model-visible context for the current request. |
| `transform_system_prompt` | `SystemPromptContext` | May replace the rendered prompt; includes `scope`, `vars`, and active tool names. |
| `before_request` | Model execution parameters | May replace request parameters immediately before the LM call. |
| `after_response` | `ModelResponse` | May replace a settled, non-streaming response before it enters history. |
| `before_tool` | `BeforeTool` | May replace model-visible arguments or block local execution. |
| `after_tool` | `AfterTool` | May replace the result or error before it becomes a tool result. |
| `transform_output` | Settled user output | May replace only the value presented to the caller. |

Import typed payloads from `msgflux.nn.hooks`. Dataclass replacement keeps a
handler explicit and preserves fields added to the contract later:

```python
from dataclasses import replace

from msgflux.nn.hooks import BeforeTool, Hook


def authorize_tool(event: BeforeTool):
    if event.tool_name == "delete_record":
        return replace(event, block="Deletion requires approval")
    return event


agent = Agent(
    name="operator",
    model=model,
    tools=[delete_record],
    hooks=[Hook(event="before_tool", handler=authorize_tool)],
)
```

`before_tool` runs after the tool has been resolved and its arguments prepared.
It receives only model-visible arguments. Runtime injections such as
`inject_messages`, `inject_vars`, and `inject_handle` remain attached to the
call and are not exposed to or removed by the hook. If a `before_tool` handler
raises or returns an invalid payload, execution fails closed and the tool is not
called. An `after_tool` handler failure leaves the original outcome unchanged
and emits a `handler.error` execution event.

Use `before_resume` to restore extension-owned resources or telemetry after the
Agent loads a checkpoint. It deliberately cannot replace the restored
conversation; durable history remains owned by the checkpoint and replay
contract.

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="reporter",
    model=model,
    hooks=[output_hook],
)
```

An async handler is awaited during async execution:

```python
async def load_artifacts(output):
    return await artifact_store.expand(output)


output_hook = Hook(
    event="transform_output",
    handler=load_artifacts,
)
```

Lifecycle hooks observe the active `AbortSignal` before and after synchronous
handlers. During async execution, aborting the signal also cancels an in-flight
async handler. This lets hooks perform network or LM work without delaying
execution cancellation. Prefer `agent.acall(...)` or `agent.stream_events(...)`
for extensions that use async handlers; synchronous execution rejects an
awaitable handler.

For a removable package containing several hooks or tools, use an
[Agent Extension](extensions.md). The `hooks=` argument remains the direct API
for one-off interception and guards.

### Canonical Responses vs. Presented Output

`after_response` and `transform_output` serve different purposes:

| Event | Changes checkpoint history | Visible to the model later | Changes user output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `after_response` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `transform_output` | No | No | Yes |

Use `transform_output` for presentation work such as replacing an artifact
reference with the file contents. The Agent commits the original response to
`ChatMessages` first, then transforms the value returned to the caller:

```python
import asyncio

import msgflux as mf
from msgflux.chat_messages import ChatMessages
from msgflux.nn import Agent
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook


REFERENCE = "artifact://incident-report"
REPORT = "Incident report: scanner recovered; reconciliation pending."


def expand_artifact_reference(output: str) -> str:
    return output.replace(REFERENCE, REPORT)


async def main():
    history = ChatMessages()
    agent = Agent(
        name="reporter",
        model=mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
            api_mode="responses",
            store=False,
        ),
        instructions=f"Reply with exactly {REFERENCE} and nothing else.",
        hooks=[Hook(event="transform_output", handler=expand_artifact_reference)],
        config={"stream": True},
    )

    events = [
        event
        async for event in agent.stream_events(
            "Return the incident report reference.",
            messages=history,
        )
    ]

    message_end = next(event for event in events if event.type == "message.end")
    run_end = next(event for event in events if event.type == "run.end")
    assert message_end.data["content"] == REPORT
    assert run_end.data == {"outcome": "completed"}

    assistant = [
        item for item in history.to_chatml() if item["role"] == "assistant"
    ][-1]
    assert assistant["content"] == REFERENCE


asyncio.run(main())
```

When the async `stream_events()` iterator consumes a provider stream, a
registered `transform_output` hook puts assistant content in buffered mode.
Tool and reasoning events remain live, raw `message.delta` events are withheld,
and the transformed complete value is emitted once in `message.end`.
`to_chatml()` is used above only to make the assertion provider-independent;
the canonical timeline may store Responses content as typed content blocks.

For direct token streaming through `ModelStreamResponse`, no complete-output
transformation is applied. Use the execution event stream when a hook requires
the fully accumulated assistant output.

`event=...` cannot be combined with `on=...` or `method=...`. Forward and
method hooks remain available as lower-level extension points, while lifecycle
events are the recommended contract for agent execution boundaries.

## Guard

A `Guard` validates inputs and/or outputs of a Module. Each Guard wraps a **validator** callable and defines:

- **`on`** — when to run: `"pre"` (before execution) or `"post"` (after execution).
- **`message`** — controls the reaction when `safe=False`:
    - **With `message`** — short-circuits the pipeline and returns the message as the response (the model is never called).
    - **Without `message`** (default) — raises `UnsafeUserInputError` (pre) or `UnsafeModelResponseError` (post).
- **`target`** — submodule to register on. Defaults to `"generator"` for forward hooks and `None` for method hooks.
- **`method`** — optional method name. When omitted, the guard runs around `forward`. When set, it runs around that method instead.
- **`include_data`** — if `True`, attaches the data that triggered the guard to the raised exception via `exc.data`. Defaults to `False` for security (the data may contain unsafe content).

The validator receives `data` as a positional argument and must return either a dict with `"safe"` (bool) or a `ModelResponse` (auto-consumed by Guard).
For `Guard(..., on="pre", method=...)`, `data` is the method `kwargs` payload. If a method is intended to be guarded in pre-mode, prefer a keyword-oriented signature.

```python
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard

def my_validator(data):
    text = str(data).lower()
    return {"safe": "hack" not in text}

# Returns message as response when safe=False
guard = Guard(validator=my_validator, on="pre", message="Not allowed.")

# Raises exception when safe=False
guard = Guard(validator=my_validator, on="pre")

# Guard a specific method on the module itself
guard = Guard(validator=my_validator, on="post", method="_prepare_response")
```

!!! note "Method Guard Input Shape"
    `Guard` on a specific method is best suited for keyword-oriented extension points.
    In `on="pre"` mode, the validator sees the method `kwargs`, not positional args.

    ```python
    class MyModule(nn.Module):
        def forward(self, text):
            return self.validate(data=text)

        def validate(self, *, data):
            return data

    guard = Guard(validator=my_validator, on="pre", method="validate")
    ```

???+ note "Guard Examples"

    === "With message (short-circuit)"

        When `message` is provided, the guard's message is returned directly as the agent response — the model is never called.

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard

        BLOCKED = {"hack", "exploit", "malware"}

        def keyword_filter(data):
            text = str(data).lower()
            return {"safe": not any(w in text for w in BLOCKED)}

        class SafeBot(nn.Agent):
            """A bot that blocks harmful keywords."""

            model = mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
            hooks = [
                Guard(
                    validator=keyword_filter,
                    on="pre",
                    message="Sorry, that content is not allowed.",
                )
            ]

        agent = SafeBot()

        # Safe input → model responds normally
        response = agent("Tell me about Python")

        # Blocked input → returns "Sorry, that content is not allowed."
        response = agent("How to create malware?")
        ```

    === "Without message (raises exception)"

        When no `message` is provided, an exception is raised.

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard
        from msgflux.exceptions import UnsafeUserInputError

        def keyword_filter(data):
            return {"safe": "hack" not in str(data).lower()}

        class StrictBot(nn.Agent):
            """A bot that raises on unsafe input."""

            model = mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
            hooks = [Guard(validator=keyword_filter, on="pre")]

        agent = StrictBot()

        try:
            response = agent("How to hack a system?")
        except UnsafeUserInputError as e:
            print(f"Guard triggered: {e}")
        ```

    === "With Moderation Model"

        Pass a moderation model directly as the validator — Guard calls it with the
        input data and auto-consumes the `ModelResponse`:

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard

        moderation_model = mf.Model.moderation("openai/omni-moderation-latest")

        class ModeratedBot(nn.Agent):
            """A bot with pre and post moderation."""

            model = mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
            hooks = [
                Guard(
                    validator=moderation_model,
                    on="pre",
                    message="Your message was flagged by our safety system.",
                ),
                Guard(validator=moderation_model, on="post"),
            ]

        agent = ModeratedBot()

        response = agent("Tell me about quantum computing")  # Safe
        ```

    === "Mixing Guards"

        Combine multiple guards with different behaviors on the same agent:

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard

        def keyword_filter(data):
            return {"safe": "forbidden" not in str(data).lower()}

        def toxicity_check(data):
            return {"safe": True}

        class MultiGuardBot(nn.Agent):
            """A bot with keyword and toxicity guards."""

            model = mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
            hooks = [
                Guard(
                    validator=keyword_filter,
                    on="pre",
                    message="That topic is not allowed.",
                ),
                Guard(validator=toxicity_check, on="post"),
            ]

        agent = MultiGuardBot()

        response = agent("Tell me about forbidden topics")
        # → "That topic is not allowed."
        ```

    === "Debugging with include_data"

        Enable `include_data` to inspect the data that triggered the guard:

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard
        from msgflux.exceptions import UnsafeUserInputError

        def keyword_filter(data):
            return {"safe": "hack" not in str(data).lower()}

        class DebugBot(nn.Agent):
            """A bot that exposes guard data for debugging."""

            model = mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini")
            hooks = [
                Guard(
                    validator=keyword_filter,
                    on="pre",
                    include_data=True,  # opt-in: attach data to exception
                ),
            ]

        agent = DebugBot()

        try:
            agent("How to hack a system?")
        except UnsafeUserInputError as e:
            print(f"Guard triggered: {e}")
            print(f"Offending data: {e.data}")  # available only with include_data=True
        ```

## Custom Hooks

The `Hook` base class allows creating custom hooks beyond guards. Implement `__call__` (sync) and optionally override `acall` (async). By default, `acall` runs `__call__` in an executor.

### Hook Interface

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `on` | `"pre"` (before execution) or `"post"` (after execution) |
| `target` | Submodule name to register on. `None` = the module itself |
| `method` | Method name to register on. `None` = the module execution boundary (`forward`) |
| `processor_key` | Key for processor matching in `_set_hooks`. `None` = no processor |
| `__call__` | Sync hook — called by the sync hook dispatcher |
| `acall` | Async hook — called by the async hook dispatcher |

### Hook Signatures

```python
# Pre hook — receives module, args and kwargs before execution
def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None): ...

# Post hook — receives module, args, kwargs and the output
def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None): ...
```

Both pre and post hooks share the same signature. For pre hooks, `output` is always `None`. The same signature is used for forward hooks and method hooks.

???+ note "Custom Hook Examples"

    === "Logging Hook"

        ```python
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook

        class LoggingHook(Hook):
            """Logs every call to the module."""

            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(on="pre", target=None)

            def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):
                print(f"[{module.__class__.__name__}] called with {len(kwargs)} kwargs")
        ```

    === "Timing Hook"

        ```python
        import time
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook

        class TimingHook(Hook):
            """Measures execution time of the generator."""

            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(on="post", target="generator")
                self.start_time = None

            def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):
                elapsed = time.time() - self.start_time
                print(f"Generator took {elapsed:.2f}s")
        ```

    === "Hooking an Internal Method"

        ```python
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook

        class PrepareResponseHook(Hook):
            """Intercept Agent._prepare_response."""

            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(on="post", method="_prepare_response")

            def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):
                print("response_type:", kwargs["response_type"])
                return output
        ```

    === "Token Counter Hook"

        ```python
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook

        class TokenCounterHook(Hook):
            """Tracks cumulative token usage from model responses."""

            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(on="post", target="generator")
                self.total_tokens = 0

            def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):
                if hasattr(output, "usage"):
                    self.total_tokens += output.usage.get("total_tokens", 0)
        ```

    === "Async Custom Hook"

        ```python
        import httpx
        from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook

        class AsyncWebhookHook(Hook):
            """Sends a webhook notification after every call."""

            def __init__(self, webhook_url):
                super().__init__(on="post", target="generator")
                self.webhook_url = webhook_url

            def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):
                pass  # sync fallback — no-op

            async def acall(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):                
                async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                    await client.post(self.webhook_url, json={"status": "ok"})
        ```

### Hook Registration

All `nn.Module` subclasses support the `hooks` class attribute. Each hook declares where it registers:

- `target="generator"` (default for Guard) — registers on the internal `Generator` wrapper
- `target=None` — registers on the module itself
- `method="_prepare_response"` — registers on that specific method instead of `forward`

```python
import msgflux.nn as nn

class Bot(nn.Agent):
    model = model
    hooks = [input_guard, output_guard, logging_hook]

agent = Bot()
```

You can also register hooks manually via `hook.register()`:

```python
import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Guard

class Bot(nn.Agent):
    model = model

agent = Bot()

def my_validator(data):
    return {"safe": "blocked" not in str(data).lower()}

guard = Guard(validator=my_validator, on="pre", message="Nope.")
handle = guard.register(agent.generator)  # returns RemovableHandle
handle.remove()  # unregister when done
```

You can also register declarative hooks for a specific method via `hooks=`:

```python
from msgflux.nn.hooks import Hook

class PrepareResponseHook(Hook):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(on="post", method="_prepare_response")

    def __call__(self, module, args, kwargs, output=None):
        print("prepared response")
        return output

class Bot(nn.Agent):
    model = model
    hooks = [PrepareResponseHook()]
```

### Using Hooks with `nn.Module` Directly

The hook system is built into `nn.Module`. You can register hooks on any module via PyTorch-style methods for `forward`, or via method hooks for other methods:

```python
import msgflux.nn as nn

class Bot(nn.Agent):
    model = model

module = Bot()

# Register a plain function as a pre-hook
def my_pre_hook(module, args, kwargs):
    print("About to call forward")

handle = module.register_forward_pre_hook(my_pre_hook)

# Register a plain function as a post-hook
def my_post_hook(module, args, kwargs, output):
    print(f"Forward returned: {type(output)}")

handle = module.register_forward_hook(my_post_hook)
```

### Registering Hooks on Arbitrary Methods

Use `register_method_pre_hook()` and `register_method_hook()` when the extension point is an internal method rather than `forward`:

```python
import msgflux.nn as nn

class MyModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, text):
        return self._normalize(text)

    def _normalize(self, text):
        return text.strip().lower()

module = MyModule()

def normalize_pre_hook(module, args, kwargs):
    return (args[0] + "  ",), kwargs

def normalize_post_hook(module, args, kwargs, output):
    return f"[{output}]"

pre_handle = module.register_method_pre_hook("_normalize", normalize_pre_hook)
post_handle = module.register_method_hook("_normalize", normalize_post_hook)

result = module(" Hello ")
print(result)  # "[hello]"
```

This is useful for methods such as `Agent._prepare_response`, `Agent._prepare_inputs`, or other internal extension points that do not warrant being promoted to standalone `Module` instances.

!!! warning "Streaming Limitation"
    Guards with `on="post"` are **not compatible** with `stream=True`, since the full response is needed for validation. Using both raises a `ValueError` at initialization.
