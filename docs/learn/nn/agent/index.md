# nn.Agent

## ✦₊⁺ Overview

The `Agent` is a `Module` that uses language models to solve tasks. It can
handle multimodal data, interact with environments through tool calls, and
manage complex workflows with structured outputs.

The Agent module adopts a task decomposition strategy, allowing each part of a
task to be treated in isolation.

### Key Features


- **Multimodal Support**: Handle text, images, audio, video, and files
- **Tool Calling**: Execute functions to interact with external systems
- **Generation Schemas**: Guides the model to generate typed responses, with support for reasoning strategies: Chain of Thought, ReAct, Self-Consistency
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize behavior through message fields and config options
- **Template System**: Use Jinja templates for prompts and responses
- **Modular System Prompt**: Compose system prompts from independent components
- **Task Decomposition**: Break down complex tasks into manageable parts
