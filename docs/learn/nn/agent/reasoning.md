# Reasoning

Modern language models can "think before answering" — generating an internal chain of thought before producing a final response. In msgFlux there are **two distinct mechanisms** for reasoning, and understanding the difference is key to using them effectively.

## Two Kinds of Reasoning

| | Model-level reasoning | Schema-level reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | The model's native thinking capability (e.g. `reasoning_effort="high"`) | A `generation_schema` that forces structured thinking (CoT, ReAct, SelfConsistency) |
| **Where reasoning lives** | `response.reasoning` — a first-class field on the response object | Inside `response.consume()` — as a field of the structured output (e.g. `result.reasoning`) |
| **Configured via** | Model params: `reasoning_effort`, `return_reasoning`, `reasoning_max_tokens` (OpenRouter only) | Agent param: `generation_schema=ChainOfThought` |
| **Works with any model** | No — requires a reasoning-capable model (Groq gpt-oss, OpenAI o-series, etc.) | Yes — any model that supports structured output |
| **Controllable budget** | Yes — `reasoning_effort`; OpenRouter also supports `reasoning_max_tokens` | No — the model decides how much to write in the schema field |
| **Can combine with tools** | Yes — `reasoning_in_tool_call=True` preserves the chain across calls | Yes — ReAct is specifically designed for tool use |

!!! tip
    You can use both simultaneously. A reasoning model with `reasoning_effort="high"` and `generation_schema=ChainOfThought` will think internally **and** produce a structured reasoning field. The internal trace goes to `response.reasoning`, the schema field goes to `response.consume().reasoning`.

For schema-level reasoning (CoT, ReAct, SelfConsistency), see [Generation Schemas](generation-schemas.md#reasoning-schemas). This page focuses on **model-level reasoning** — the first-class `response.reasoning` field.

---

## 1. Configuration

Model-level reasoning is configured at model initialization through parameters forwarded to the provider:

```python
import msgflux as mf

model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
    "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    return_reasoning=True,        # Store the trace in response.reasoning (default: True)
    reasoning_max_tokens=1024,    # OpenRouter only: cap the thinking budget in tokens
    reasoning_in_tool_call=True,  # Preserve reasoning across tool call rounds
)
```

At the Agent level, one additional config key controls how reasoning is surfaced in the Agent's output:

| Config key | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reasoning_in_response` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, the Agent wraps its output as `dotdict(answer=raw_response, reasoning=reasoning)` instead of returning the raw response. |

```python
import msgflux.nn as nn

class Solver(nn.Agent):
    model = model
    instructions = "Solve the problem step by step."
    config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}
```

!!! info "Why `reasoning_in_response` exists"
    By default, the Agent returns the raw response (`str` for text, `dict` for structured output). The reasoning is still available on the underlying `ModelResponse`, but the Agent's `forward()` returns only the content. If your downstream code needs **both** the answer and the reasoning in a single object, enable `reasoning_in_response`. The contract is uniform: always `dotdict(answer=..., reasoning=...)` regardless of whether the raw response is a `str` or `dict`.

---

## 2. Non-Streaming

In non-streaming mode, the model completes its full response before returning. Reasoning is available immediately as a string field.

### Basic usage

???+ example

    === "Default (raw response)"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="low",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Solve the problem. Answer with just the result."

        agent = Solver()
        response = agent("What is 15 * 7 + 3?")

        print(type(response))  # <class 'str'>
        print(response)        # "108"
        ```

        The reasoning trace is **not** in the Agent's return value. It lives on the `ModelResponse` inside the pipeline. To access it, use `reasoning_in_response`.

    === "With reasoning_in_response"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="low",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Solve the problem. Answer with just the result."
            config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}

        agent = Solver()
        response = agent("What is 15 * 7 + 3?")

        print(type(response))       # <class 'dotdict'>
        print(response.answer)      # "108"
        print(response.reasoning)   # "15 * 7 = 105, then 105 + 3 = 108"
        ```

    === "Without reasoning"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="low",
            return_reasoning=False,  # Discard reasoning
        )

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Solve the problem."
            config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}

        agent = Solver()
        response = agent("What is 2 + 2?")

        # No reasoning available → no wrapping, plain str
        print(type(response))  # <class 'str'>
        print(response)        # "4"
        ```

        When `return_reasoning=False` (or the model simply doesn't reason), `reasoning` is `None` and `reasoning_in_response` has no effect — the Agent returns the raw response as-is.

    === "Async"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="low",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Solve the problem. Answer with just the result."
            config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}

        agent = Solver()
        response = await agent.acall("What is 15 * 7 + 3?")

        print(response.answer)     # "108"
        print(response.reasoning)  # "15 * 7 = 105, then 105 + 3 = 108"
        ```

### How it works internally

When the Agent calls the model in non-streaming mode, the pipeline is:

```
Agent.forward("What is 15 * 7?")
  │
  ├── _execute_model() → ModelResponse
  │     ├── .data = "108"                     ← the answer
  │     ├── .reasoning = "15*7=105..."        ← the trace
  │     ├── .has_reasoning = True
  │     └── .response_type = "text_generation"
  │
  └── _process_model_response()
        ├── raw_response = model_response.consume()        → "108"
        ├── reasoning = model_response.reasoning           → "15*7=105..."
        │
        └── _prepare_response()
              └── _apply_reasoning_in_response(raw_response, reasoning)
                    ├── reasoning_in_response=True  → dotdict(answer="108", reasoning="15*7=105...")
                    └── reasoning_in_response=False → "108"
```

The key insight is that `model_response.reasoning` is **always** populated (when the provider returns it), regardless of the `reasoning_in_response` config. The config only controls whether the Agent wraps the output.

---

## 3. Streaming

Streaming with reasoning introduces a **dual-queue architecture**. Content and reasoning flow through independent queues, allowing consumers to process them in parallel or sequentially.

### Consuming streams

When `stream=True`, the Agent returns a `ModelStreamResponse`. Both `consume()` and `consume_reasoning()` are async generators:

???+ example

    === "Content + Reasoning"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="low",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Assistant(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Answer concisely."
            config = {"stream": True}

        agent = Assistant()
        response = await agent.acall("What is 2+2?")

        # Consume content chunks
        async for chunk in response.consume():
            print(chunk, end="", flush=True)

        print()

        # Consume reasoning chunks
        async for chunk in response.consume_reasoning():
            print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
        ```

    === "Reasoning First"

        The queues are independent — you can consume reasoning before content. This is useful when you want to display the chain of thought in a UI before showing the answer:

        ```python
        response = await agent.acall("Solve: 15 * 7 + 3")

        # Read reasoning first
        print("Thinking:")
        async for chunk in response.consume_reasoning():
            print(chunk, end="", flush=True)

        # Then read the answer
        print("\n\nAnswer:")
        async for chunk in response.consume():
            print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
        ```

    === "Sync Polling"

        In sync contexts, the stream runs in a background thread. After the stream completes, the accumulated fields are available:

        ```python
        import time

        agent = Assistant()
        response = agent("What is 2+2?")

        # first_chunk_event fires on the first token (often reasoning)
        response.first_chunk_event.wait(timeout=10)

        # Wait for stream to complete
        for _ in range(50):
            if response.metadata is not None:
                break
            time.sleep(0.1)

        # After completion
        print(response.reasoning)       # Full accumulated reasoning
        print(response.has_reasoning)   # True
        ```

    === "FastAPI — Dual Endpoints"

        ```python
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        app = FastAPI()

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="low",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Assistant(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Answer concisely."
            config = {"stream": True}

        agent = Assistant()

        @app.get("/chat")
        async def chat(query: str):
            response = await agent.acall(query)
            return StreamingResponse(
                response.consume(),
                media_type="text/plain",
            )

        @app.get("/chat/reasoning")
        async def chat_reasoning(query: str):
            response = await agent.acall(query)
            return StreamingResponse(
                response.consume_reasoning(),
                media_type="text/plain",
            )
        ```

### The two-event system

Streaming responses use two events to signal different stages:

| Event | Fires when | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `first_chunk_event` | First token arrives (reasoning **or** content) | Signals the stream is alive. Fires early — often on the first reasoning token. |
| `_response_type_event` | `response_type` is determined (`"text_generation"` or `"tool_call"`) | The Agent waits on this event before deciding how to process the response. |

This separation matters because reasoning models emit reasoning tokens **before** any content. Without it, the Agent would block on `response_type` until the first content token arrives — potentially seconds of wasted time.

```
Timeline:
  ┌─ reasoning tokens ──────────────────┐┌── content tokens ───────────┐
  │  think think think think think ...   ││  Hello, the answer is ...   │
  ▲                                      ▲                              ▲
  │                                      │                              │
  first_chunk_event                      _response_type_event           metadata set
  (fires here)                           (fires here)                   (stream done)
```

Inside the Agent, the flow is:

```python
# Agent._process_model_response():
if isinstance(model_response, ModelStreamResponse):
    wait_for_event(model_response._response_type_event)  # blocks here, not on first_chunk

# Now response_type is guaranteed to be set
if "tool_call" in model_response.response_type:
    # enter tool call loop...
else:
    # return stream response to caller
```

### How the dual-queue works internally

```
Provider stream (background thread)
│
├── reasoning chunk → add_reasoning(chunk)
│     ├── has_reasoning = True         (first time only)
│     ├── first_chunk_event.set()      (first time only)
│     └── chunk → reasoning queue
│
├── content chunk  → add(chunk)
│     ├── set_response_type("text_generation")
│     │   └── _response_type_event.set()   (first time only)
│     ├── first_chunk_event.set()          (if not already)
│     └── chunk → content queue
│
└── finally:
      ├── stream_response.reasoning = accumulated   ← full text available
      ├── add_reasoning(None)                       ← sentinel (end of reasoning)
      ├── add(None)                                 ← sentinel (end of content)
      ├── _response_type_event.set()                ← safety net
      └── set_metadata(usage)
```

Each queue uses a `deque` as a pending buffer that is flushed into an `asyncio.Queue` when a consumer first calls `consume()` / `consume_reasoning()`. The `None` sentinel signals end-of-stream to the async generator.

The queues are the live delivery path. In parallel, `ChatStreamAccumulator`
combines those deltas into ordered interaction items. A checkpoint receives the
accumulator snapshot only when the stream completes, fails, or is interrupted;
it never stores one record per token and the Agent does not append a second
copy reconstructed from `stream_response.reasoning` and `.data`.

### Reasoning saved in history

Reasoning history has two layers:

- `text` and `summary` are normalized fields that can be inspected or adapted
  to another provider.
- `provider_state` is an opaque payload paired with the provider that produced
  it. Examples include encrypted reasoning, OpenRouter `reasoning_details`,
  redacted thinking, and thought signatures.

msgFlux preserves opaque state without interpreting it and sends it back only
to the same provider. The field may be attached to any interaction item—not
only a reasoning item—because some providers sign a function-call part. Moving
a trajectory to another provider can retain normalized text or summaries, but
does not promise that provider-specific reasoning state is portable.

!!! info "reasoning_in_response has no effect in streaming"
    When `stream=True`, the Agent returns the `ModelStreamResponse` directly — it does not wrap it. The consumer accesses reasoning through `consume_reasoning()` and content through `consume()`. The `reasoning_in_response` config only applies to non-streaming responses.

---

## 4. Reasoning Across Tool Calls

When a reasoning model calls tools, it normally loses its chain of thought between rounds. Enable `reasoning_in_tool_call=True` on the model to preserve the reasoning context.

### How it works

After each tool-call round, msgFlux adds the reasoning, function calls, and
function outputs to the same provider-neutral interaction timeline. Reasoning
is stored once as a `reasoning` item; it is not copied into the assistant
message as `<think>` text.

Immediately before the next request, the selected model converts that timeline
to its provider format. This conversion happens inside the model, after gateway
routing, so opaque state such as OpenRouter `reasoning_details` is returned only
when the selected provider matches the provider that produced it.

```
Interaction timeline:
[
  {"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "What is (14+28)*3-7?"},

  {"type": "reasoning", "role": "assistant",
   "text": "I need to compute (14+28) first."},
  {"type": "function_call", "call_id": "call_1",
   "name": "calc", "arguments": "{\"expr\":\"14+28\"}"},
  {"type": "function_call_output", "call_id": "call_1", "output": "42"},

  {"type": "reasoning", "role": "assistant",
   "text": "14+28=42. Now I need 42*3."},
  {"type": "function_call", "call_id": "call_2",
   "name": "calc", "arguments": "{\"expr\":\"42*3\"}"},
  {"type": "function_call_output", "call_id": "call_2", "output": "126"},
  {"type": "message", "role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is 119."}
]
```

The selected model sees the compatible representation of its previous
reasoning at each step, enabling coherent multi-step problem solving without a
second copy in history.

!!! info "History and response have different views"
    The interaction timeline retains each reasoning item needed for later model
    calls and checkpoints. `ModelResponse.reasoning` exposes the reasoning from
    the current model call to application code; it is not another persisted
    history store.

???+ example

    === "Basic Tool Call with Reasoning"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            """Add two numbers together."""
            return a + b

        def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            """Multiply two numbers together."""
            return a * b

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="high",
            return_reasoning=True,
            reasoning_in_tool_call=True,
        )

        class Calculator(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Use the tools to compute the result. Answer with just the number."
            tools = [add, multiply]

        agent = Calculator()
        response = agent("What is (3 + 5) * 4?")
        print(response)  # "32"
        ```

    === "With reasoning_in_response"

        ```python
        class Calculator(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Use the tools to compute the result. Answer with just the number."
            tools = [add, multiply]
            config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}

        agent = Calculator()
        response = agent("What is (3 + 5) * 4?")

        # If the final model call includes reasoning:
        if isinstance(response, dict):
            print(response.answer)     # "32"
            print(response.reasoning)  # "3+5=8, 8*4=32"
        else:
            # Final call had no reasoning (model may skip it on simple answers)
            print(response)  # "32"
        ```

    === "Async with Tools"

        ```python
        agent = Calculator()
        response = await agent.acall("What is (3 + 5) * 4?")
        print(response)  # "32"
        ```

!!! warning "Reasoning on the final call is not guaranteed"
    After the tool call loop completes, the model makes a final call to produce the answer. This final call may or may not include reasoning — it depends on the model and the complexity of the remaining task. When `reasoning_in_response=True` and the final call has no reasoning, the Agent returns the raw response (no `dotdict` wrapping).

---

## 5. Combining with Generation Schemas

Model-level reasoning and schema-level reasoning serve different purposes and can be combined:

| Approach | Reasoning lives in | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Model-level only | `response.reasoning` | When you want the model's native thinking without constraining the output format |
| Schema-level only | `response.consume().reasoning` | When you want explicit, structured reasoning visible in the output |
| Both combined | Both fields populated | Maximum reasoning quality — the model thinks internally **and** produces structured reasoning |

???+ example

    === "Model-level only"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="high",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            instructions = "Solve the problem."
            config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}

        agent = Solver()
        response = agent("What is 25 * 4 + 17?")

        # response.answer = "117"
        # response.reasoning = "25 * 4 = 100, 100 + 17 = 117"  (model's internal trace)
        ```

    === "Schema-level only"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.generation.reasoning import ChainOfThought

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini")  # no reasoning_effort

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            generation_schema = ChainOfThought

        agent = Solver()
        result = agent("What is 25 * 4 + 17?")

        # result.reasoning = "Step 1: 25 * 4 = 100..."  (schema field)
        # result.final_answer = "117"
        ```

    === "Both combined"

        ```python
        import msgflux as mf
        import msgflux.nn as nn
        from msgflux.generation.reasoning import ChainOfThought

        model = mf.Model.chat_completion(
            "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
            reasoning_effort="high",
            return_reasoning=True,
        )

        class Solver(nn.Agent):
            model = model
            generation_schema = ChainOfThought
            config = {"reasoning_in_response": True}

        agent = Solver()
        response = agent("What is 25 * 4 + 17?")

        # response.answer = {"reasoning": "Step 1: ...", "final_answer": "117"}  (schema)
        # response.reasoning = "The user asks 25*4+17. Let me compute..."        (model trace)
        ```

        The schema reasoning is a structured, user-facing explanation. The model reasoning is the raw internal trace — often more detailed and less polished.

## 6. Verbose Mode

When `verbose=True`, the Agent prints both the reasoning trace and the response to the console:

```python
class Solver(nn.Agent):
    model = model
    instructions = "Solve the problem."
    config = {"verbose": True}

agent = Solver()
agent("What is 15 * 7?")
```

Console output:

```
[solver][reasoning] 15 * 7 = 105
[solver][response] 105
```

This is useful for debugging the relationship between the model's thinking and its final answer.

## 7. Quick Reference

### Model parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reasoning_effort` | `str` | — | `"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"` |
| `return_reasoning` | `bool` | `True` | Store reasoning in `response.reasoning` |
| `reasoning_max_tokens` | `int` | — | OpenRouter-only cap on reasoning token budget |
| `reasoning_in_tool_call` | `bool` | `False` | Embed reasoning in `<think>` tags across tool call rounds |
| `enable_thinking` | `bool` | `False` | Provider-level switch (e.g. Anthropic) |

### Agent config

| Config key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reasoning_in_response` | `bool` | `False` | Wrap output as `dotdict(answer=..., reasoning=...)` |

### Response API

| Non-streaming | Streaming | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `response.consume()` → `str` or `dict` | `response.consume()` → `AsyncGenerator[str, None]` | Final answer |
| `response.consume_reasoning()` → `str` or `None` | `response.consume_reasoning()` → `AsyncGenerator[str, None]` | Reasoning trace |
| `response.reasoning` → `str` or `None` | `response.reasoning` → `str` or `None` (after stream ends) | Direct attribute |
| `response.has_reasoning` → `bool` (property) | `response.has_reasoning` → `bool` (mutable flag) | Discoverability |
