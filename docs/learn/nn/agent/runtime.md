# Runtime

Runtime is the layer used to identify, resume, interrupt, and feed an agent
while it is executing.

The core pieces are:

| Piece | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ExecutionScope` | Identifies the active execution with `thread_id`, `run_id`, and `namespace`. |
| `AbortSignal` | Carries local cancellation requests to the active runtime before safe interruption points. |
| `CheckpointStore` | Persists the agent snapshot so a run can resume. |
| `TaskStore` | Persists background task records, activity, outputs, and routing metadata. |
| `AgentInbox` | Holds pending messages, notifications, and control signals for the agent loop. |
| `AgentInboxStore` | Optional persistence boundary for the inbox. Without one, the inbox is in memory. |

## Execution Scope

Use `ExecutionScope` when you need stable runtime identity.

```python
import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="incident_analyst",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini"),
)

scope = mf.ExecutionScope(
    thread_id="warehouse_incident_42",
    run_id="initial_analysis",
)

incident_log = """
09:02 - Scanner A stopped sending inventory updates.
09:07 - Orders continued to reserve stock from the last known snapshot.
09:18 - Operations restarted Scanner A; queued updates began arriving.
09:23 - Two orders were found with overlapping reservations for SKU-1842.
09:31 - New reservations were paused for SKU-1842.
"""

result = agent(
    "Identify the likely failure sequence, customer impact, and next actions "
    f"from this incident log:\n{incident_log}",
    scope=scope,
)
```

- `thread_id`: identifies the conversation thread. In a chat UI, this is the
  conversation id. In a workflow, it is the root workflow id. Every execution
  that should share history and durable context should keep the same
  `thread_id`.
- `namespace`: identifies the component that owns runtime state. For agents,
  msgFlux uses the agent module name as the effective namespace.
- `run_id`: identifies one resumable execution inside that thread. For a root
  agent this usually means one turn, command, or workflow step. For a
  background subagent, it is the task id. Reusing the same `run_id` means "try
  to resume this execution"; using a new `run_id` means "start new work in the
  same conversation". A subagent uses its own `thread_id`; parent/root lineage
  is carried separately by `parent_run_id` and `root_run_id`.

If no scope is passed, msgFlux generates runtime identifiers:

```text
thread_id = generated thd_<uuid>
namespace = default_namespace
run_id = generated run_<uuid>
```

These generated IDs are convenient local fallbacks. They are correct for
one-off calls, but they are not enough for recovery after a process restart. If
you need durability, provide the same `thread_id` and `run_id` again when
re-dispatching the work.

Resolution prefers explicit values, then existing message state, then inherited
runtime context, and only then generates a fallback. Omit an ID when you want
msgFlux to inherit it from the current context; pass an ID when you want to
force a specific execution identity.

## Checkpointing

Use a checkpoint store when a run should resume after a pause, interruption,
process restart, or tool-driven continuation. `ExecutionScope` provides the
checkpoint identity; `CheckpointStore` persists the execution state associated
with that identity.

You can bind the store directly to the agent:

```python
import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn

checkpoint_store = mf.Store.checkpoint(
    "sqlite",
    path=".msgflux/checkpoints.sqlite3",
)

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="incident_analyst",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini"),
    checkpoint_store=checkpoint_store,
)

scope = mf.ExecutionScope(
    thread_id="warehouse_incident_42",
    run_id="initial_analysis",
)

incident_log = """
09:02 - Scanner A stopped sending inventory updates.
09:07 - Orders continued to reserve stock from the last known snapshot.
09:18 - Operations restarted Scanner A; queued updates began arriving.
09:23 - Two orders were found with overlapping reservations for SKU-1842.
09:31 - New reservations were paused for SKU-1842.
"""

result = agent(
    "Identify the likely failure sequence, customer impact, and next actions "
    f"from this incident log:\n{incident_log}",
    scope=scope,
)
```

Alternatively, provide the same store through `execution_context(...)`. The
task and identity values remain the same; the context supplies the scope to the
agent call:

```python
import msgflux as mf
import msgflux.nn as nn

checkpoint_store = mf.Store.checkpoint(
    "sqlite",
    path=".msgflux/checkpoints.sqlite3",
)

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="incident_analyst",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini"),
)

scope = mf.ExecutionScope(
    thread_id="warehouse_incident_42",
    run_id="initial_analysis",
)

incident_log = """
09:02 - Scanner A stopped sending inventory updates.
09:07 - Orders continued to reserve stock from the last known snapshot.
09:18 - Operations restarted Scanner A; queued updates began arriving.
09:23 - Two orders were found with overlapping reservations for SKU-1842.
09:31 - New reservations were paused for SKU-1842.
"""

with mf.execution_context(scope=scope, checkpoint_store=checkpoint_store):
    result = agent(
        "Identify the likely failure sequence, customer impact, and next actions "
        f"from this incident log:\n{incident_log}"
    )
```

`ExecutionScope` carries identity; it does not store runtime resources. The
context manager propagates both the scope and resources such as
`checkpoint_store`, `task_store`, and `agent_inbox` to nested runtime calls.

`Agent(checkpoint_store=...)` and
`execution_context(checkpoint_store=...)` accept the same `CheckpointStore`
abstraction. If both are provided, the store bound directly to the agent takes
precedence over the store inherited from the execution context.

Revisioned stores keep a `_checkpoint` envelope with a schema version,
monotonic revision, branch identity, active head item, and extension state.
Commits may provide `expected_revision`; stale writers are rejected atomically
and their state and event are not persisted. Existing snapshots without this
envelope remain readable and acquire revision `0` on their next revisioned
commit. Forks start a new root branch and retain the source namespace, run,
branch, and head in `_checkpoint.fork_of` for provenance.

Inside the call, the agent resolves the effective scope first. It then uses the
active checkpoint store to load or save state under the effective
`(namespace, thread_id, run_id)` key.

??? tip "Available checkpoint stores"

    - `mf.Store.checkpoint("in_memory")`
    - `mf.Store.checkpoint("sqlite", path=".msgflux/checkpoints.sqlite3")`

When you call an agent with a `scope.run_id`, msgFlux first checks whether a
checkpoint already exists for `(namespace, thread_id, run_id)`.

Resume behavior:

- `running`: resumed from the saved snapshot.
- `paused`: resumed from the saved snapshot.
- `failed`: resumed from the saved snapshot. This is the primary recovery path
  after a provider, tool, process, or infrastructure failure.
- `completed`: not resumed.
- `interrupted`: not resumed.

On resume, the new task input is ignored and the saved interaction timeline
continues from the checkpointed state. `vars` is deliberately not part of
`ChatMessages` or the checkpoint: the current call supplies it as an ordinary
dictionary. This is intentional—the retry restores the same execution instead
of adding another user message. Use the same `thread_id` with a new `run_id`
when you want to continue the conversation with fresh input.

### Interaction timeline

`ChatMessages` persists one provider-neutral timeline. Messages, reasoning,
tool calls, tool results, and turn lifecycle events are all ordered items in
that timeline; there is no second copy of turn inputs, assistant output, vars,
or response type.

Each model response may also annotate its final generated item with model audit
metadata produced by the LM: `provider`, `model_id`, `api_mode`, and
`reasoning_effort` when it was used. The same item retains the minimal usage
counters `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and `cached_input_tokens` when the
provider reports them. Derived totals, cache percentages, costs, and the raw
provider payload are not checkpointed. These metadata annotations are for
inspection and are not sent back to the model provider.

Turn events are `start`, `pause`, `resume`, `complete`, `fail`, and
`interrupt`. The `messages.turns` property is a calculated view of those
events, not additional persisted state. This means a failed or paused turn can
resume without duplicating its messages.

An unfinished `ModelStreamResponse` temporarily owns the `ChatMessages`
instance supplied to that run. Finish or abort the stream before starting a
second run with the same object. msgFlux rejects overlapping use instead of
allowing an older stream finalizer to overwrite newer messages. If application
code mutates the history directly while the stream is open, the completed
stream can still be saved to its own checkpoint, but it will not replace the
newer in-memory timeline.

Every occurrence has a stable `item_id`, even when two items have identical
content. Use that identity to create an append-only branch at an exact history
boundary. For example, fork immediately after the first completed turn:

```python
state = checkpoint_store.load_state(namespace, thread_id, run_id)
first_complete = next(
    item
    for item in state["messages"]["items"]
    if item.get("type") == "turn" and item.get("event") == "complete"
)

forked = checkpoint_store.fork_run(
    namespace,
    source_thread_id=thread_id,
    source_run_id=run_id,
    target_thread_id=f"{thread_id}_review",
    target_run_id=f"{run_id}_review",
    at_item_id=first_complete["item_id"],
    position="at",
    status="paused",
)
```

Use `position="before"` to exclude the selected item itself. The store rejects
a boundary inside an active turn or between a tool call and its output. History
alternatives use explicit forks. Conversation compaction also remains
append-only: it records a complete model-visible view at a completed-turn
boundary without rewriting existing items. See
[Conversation Compaction](compaction.md) for configuration and replay behavior.

For background subagents, the task id is used as the subagent `run_id`. Reusing
that task id resumes or continues the same subagent. Creating a new task id
starts a separate subagent execution with its own conversation identity.

The checkpoint store can also be used directly when you need to inspect or
manage durable runs outside the agent loop. The lookup key is always
`(namespace, thread_id, run_id)`. For an agent, `namespace` is normally the
agent name:

```python
namespace = "incident_analyst"
thread_id = "warehouse_incident_42"
run_id = "initial_analysis"

state = checkpoint_store.load_state(namespace, thread_id, run_id)
print(state["status"] if state else "missing")
```

List recent runs for a thread:

```python
runs = checkpoint_store.list_runs(namespace, thread_id, limit=10)
for run in runs:
    print(run["run_id"], run["status"], run["updated_at"])
```

Find runs that may still need recovery:

```python
incomplete = checkpoint_store.find_incomplete_runs(namespace, thread_id)
```

Load the newest checkpointed run in a thread. This is useful when the caller
has a `thread_id` but did not persist the latest `run_id` separately:

```python
latest = checkpoint_store.load_latest_run(namespace, thread_id)
```

Fork a complete checkpoint into a new thread/run. Omitting `at_item_id` copies
the whole state while preserving the original run:

```python
state = checkpoint_store.load_state(
    namespace,
    "warehouse_incident_42",
    "initial_analysis",
)
second_turn_start = next(
    item
    for item in state["messages"]["items"]
    if item.get("type") == "turn"
    and item.get("event") == "start"
    and item.get("index") == 1
)

forked = checkpoint_store.fork_run(
    namespace,
    source_thread_id="warehouse_incident_42",
    source_run_id="initial_analysis",
    target_thread_id="warehouse_incident_42_review",
    target_run_id="initial_analysis_review",
    status="paused",
)
```

To fork a prefix instead, pass the stable `item_id` and choose whether that
occurrence is included:

```python
forked = checkpoint_store.fork_run(
    namespace,
    source_thread_id="warehouse_incident_42",
    source_run_id="initial_analysis",
    target_thread_id="warehouse_incident_42_review",
    target_run_id="before_second_turn",
    at_item_id=second_turn_start["item_id"],
    position="before",
)
```

Delete a single run when it is no longer needed:

```python
deleted = checkpoint_store.delete_run(namespace, thread_id, run_id)
```

Clear a broader set of checkpoints:

```python
removed = checkpoint_store.clear(namespace=namespace, thread_id=thread_id)
```

Stores also expose low-level event methods for append-only audit entries:

```python
checkpoint_store.append_event(
    namespace,
    thread_id,
    run_id,
    {"type": "operator_note", "message": "Reviewed by support lead."},
)

events = checkpoint_store.load_events(namespace, thread_id, run_id)
```

## Agent Inbox

`Agent` creates a memory-backed inbox by default:

```python
agent = nn.Agent(
    name="policy_assistant",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini"),
)

agent.agent_inbox.store
# InMemoryAgentInboxStore(...)
```

When you instantiate `AgentInbox` directly, pass a store. Direct inbox creation
without a store raises an error, because the inbox needs a persistence boundary
to queue and drain notifications. Use an explicit store when pending messages
and control signals should survive process restarts or be shared by inbox
handles created in different places:

```python
inbox_store = mf.Store.agent_inbox(
    "sqlite",
    path=".msgflux/inbox.sqlite3",
)
agent_inbox = mf.AgentInbox(store=inbox_store)

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="policy_assistant",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini"),
    agent_inbox=agent_inbox,
)
```

You can also provide the inbox through runtime context instead of binding it to
the agent instance:

```python
scope = mf.ExecutionScope(
    thread_id="refund_conversation_42",
    run_id="refund_summary_01",
)
agent_inbox.bind_scope(scope, namespace="policy_assistant")

with mf.execution_context(scope=scope, agent_inbox=agent_inbox):
    agent("Summarize this policy: Returns are accepted within 30 days.")
```

Use a stable `thread_id` for any workflow that expects inbox delivery across
multiple turns, tools, or background tasks. If no scope is provided, msgFlux
generates fallback `thread_id` and `run_id` values for local execution. Those
generated identifiers are valid runtime keys, but another producer cannot
reliably target the same inbox unless it uses the same scope.

??? tip "Available inbox stores"

    - `mf.Store.agent_inbox("in_memory")`
    - `mf.Store.agent_inbox("sqlite", path=".msgflux/inbox.sqlite3")`

You can also instantiate concrete classes directly, but the `Store` factory is
the preferred public interface for application code.

Bind an inbox to a runtime identity when you want to write to the same pending
message queue that an agent will drain:

```python
scope = mf.ExecutionScope(thread_id="refund_conversation_42", run_id="refund_summary_01")

agent_inbox = mf.AgentInbox(store=inbox_store)
agent_inbox.bind_scope(scope, namespace="policy_assistant")

agent("Summarize this policy: Returns are accepted within 30 days.", scope=scope)
```

Use `fork(...)` to create another handle over the same store with a different
runtime key. This is useful when a root agent launches child work but you still
want a shared store:

```python
child_inbox = agent_inbox.fork(
    owner="research_agent",
    namespace="research_agent",
    run_id="task_123",
)
```

### Inspecting And Rendering Inbox Items

`peek()` reads pending notifications without removing them:

```python
pending = agent_inbox.peek()
```

`drain()` reads and clears the pending notifications for the current inbox key.
The key includes the agent namespace and `thread_id`, so notifications for one
conversation are not drained by another conversation:

```python
notifications = agent_inbox.drain()
```

If you used `peek()` and processed only some items, acknowledge them explicitly
by id:

```python
agent_inbox.ack([notification.notification_id for notification in notifications])
```

`render_messages(...)` converts inbox items into provider-ready chat messages.
System notifications become a `system` message, while incoming user messages
become a `user` message:

```python
messages = agent_inbox.render_messages(notifications)
```

`render(...)` is a convenience wrapper: it returns `None` for an empty list, one
message dict for a single rendered message, or a list when multiple messages are
needed:

```python
rendered = agent_inbox.render(notifications)
```

### Sending Messages While The Agent Is Running

To feed a running agent, write an incoming user message to the same inbox. The
agent drains the inbox before each provider call and after tool calls, before
the next provider call.

```python
inbox_store = mf.Store.agent_inbox("sqlite", path=".msgflux/inbox.sqlite3")
agent_inbox = mf.AgentInbox(store=inbox_store)
scope = mf.ExecutionScope(thread_id="refund_conversation_42", run_id="refund_summary_01")
agent_inbox.bind_scope(scope, namespace="policy_assistant")

agent = nn.Agent(
    name="policy_assistant",
    model=mf.Model.chat_completion("openai/gpt-4.1-mini"),
    agent_inbox=agent_inbox,
)

# In one thread/task:
agent(
    "Draft a two-sentence reply using this policy: Returns are accepted within 30 days.",
    scope=scope,
)

# In another thread/task while the agent is still processing:
agent_inbox.user_message("Keep the reply under 50 words.")
```

The model receives the message as a synthetic user block:

```xml
<incoming_user_message>
Keep the reply under 50 words.
</incoming_user_message>
```

If the writer does not have the `agent` object, create another inbox with the
same store and execution key:

```python
store = mf.Store.agent_inbox("sqlite", path=".msgflux/inbox.sqlite3")
scope = mf.ExecutionScope(thread_id="refund_conversation_42", run_id="refund_summary_01")

external_inbox = mf.AgentInbox(
    store=store,
    namespace="policy_assistant",
    thread_id=scope.thread_id,
    run_id=scope.run_id,
)

external_inbox.user_message("Ask for the latest invoice number before deciding.")
```

If the pending user messages become stale, clear only those messages while
preserving runtime notifications and control signals:

```python
removed = external_inbox.clear_user_messages()
print(f"Removed {removed} pending user message(s).")
```

To attach metadata to a new user message, use the dedicated method:

```python
external_inbox.user_message(
    "Keep the reply under 50 words.",
    metadata={"origin": "chat-ui"},
)
```

### Images and described conversation messages

`user_message()` also accepts a non-empty list of canonical text/image blocks.
Use `ChatBlock.image()` with an HTTP(S) URL or an image data URI:

```python
from msgflux.utils.chat import ChatBlock

external_inbox.user_message([
    ChatBlock.text("Please inspect this screenshot."),
    ChatBlock.image("https://example.com/screenshot.png", detail="low"),
])
```

This publishes an ordinary incoming user message containing both text and an
image. Image-only messages are supported too. The inbox stores and forwards
blocks; it does not download URLs, read host paths or decode images. To publish
local bytes already obtained through authorized access, the publisher can use
`Image(image_bytes)()` from `msgflux.data.types` to prepare an image block.
Only text and images are supported here, not audio, video or arbitrary provider
payloads. Actual image support depends on the selected model/provider.

Use `message()` for content that should arrive as role `user` without claiming
to be a new message from the human user:

```python
external_inbox.message(
    [ChatBlock.image("https://example.com/chart.png")],
    description="Image produced by the referenced tool call.",
    source="render_chart",
    ref="call_123",
)
```

The resulting message contains a short `incoming_message` text wrapper with
the source, reference and description, followed by the image and closing text.
It does not use `incoming_user_message`. Source and reference are also retained
in history metadata. These labels document provenance; they do not authenticate
publishers or grant authority. Descriptions and text are escaped, and role is
always `user`, never a publisher-controlled system role.

Inside a tool, the existing notification handle can publish the same content:

```python
from msgflux.tools import Hidden, ToolLibraryHandle
from msgflux.tools.config import tool_config

@tool_config(runtime_inputs=["handle"], retry=False)
def show_chart(*, handle: Hidden[ToolLibraryHandle]) -> str:
    """Attach a chart to the next model turn."""
    handle.get_notification().message(
        [ChatBlock.image("https://example.com/chart.png")],
        description="Chart attached by this tool call.",
    )
    return "The image follows as a user-role message."
```

The handle supplies its source and reference: a tool-call ID for foreground
calls, or the existing task reference for background tools. Foreground delivery
follows the tool results, before the next provider request. Multiple described
or multimodal conversation messages retain their relative inbox order; system
notifications retain their existing separate rendering. Background publication
is delivered at the next inbox drain, not synchronized with a future task result.
`clear_user_messages()` removes user-origin text/images but preserves described
messages and runtime signals.

Memory and SQLite stores use the existing claim/receipt/ack mechanism for these
messages. Checkpoints preserve the image blocks; URL references are not immutable
snapshots and data URIs increase storage size. This increment does not add an
artifact store or make publication atomic with external tool effects. It also
does not delegate to a vision model: the main agent/application must explicitly
choose delegation when needed. No native multimodal tool-output support is
required, but multimodal user-message support still is.

### Control Messages

Control messages interrupt execution at safe provider boundaries.

```python
agent_inbox.pause(reason="Wait for user approval.")
agent_inbox.interrupt(reason="Operator interrupted the run.")
```

Behavior:

- `pause` raises `TaskPauseRequestedError` and checkpoints the run as `paused`
  when a checkpoint store is configured.
- `interrupt` raises `TaskInterruptRequestedError` and checkpoints the run as
  `interrupted` when a checkpoint store is configured.
- Unknown control commands remain normal system notifications.

For a persistent writer:

```python
external_inbox.pause(reason="Need human review before continuing.")
```

### Recoverable Inbox Delivery

Inbox delivery uses a short lease while an Agent transforms and persists a
notification. A claimed notification is acknowledged after the Agent
checkpoint succeeds. If a hook fails or the process stops before that point,
the lease expires and another execution can claim the notification again.

You can use the explicit operations when integrating a worker or external
consumer:

```python
claimed = agent_inbox.claim(lease_seconds=30)
try:
    # Process the notifications and persist the resulting Agent state.
    agent_inbox.ack(item.notification_id for item in claimed)
except BaseException:
    agent_inbox.release()
    raise
```

Claims coordinate separate inbox views and SQLite connections. Acknowledging
a notification is safe to repeat by its notification ID; external tools still
eed their own idempotency keys because the framework cannot make an external
side effect exactly once across a process crash.

### System Notifications

Non-user inbox items are delivered as compact system notifications:

```python
agent_inbox.publish(
    {
        "source": "policy",
        "status": "policy_update",
        "metadata": {"policy": "Returns are accepted within 30 days."},
    }
)
```

The model receives:

```xml
<notification source="policy" status="policy_update" policy="Returns are accepted within 30 days."/>
```

Use `user_message(...)` for new user turns. Use a machine-friendly source such
as `policy`, `task`, or `operator` for state that is not a direct user request.

## Live authority

`ExecutionScope` carries optional `principal` identity and immutable
`PermissionSet` grants. These belong to the generic runtime, not to the model's
messages or Agent variables.

```python
from msgflux.runtime import ExecutionScope, PermissionSet, execution_context

scope = ExecutionScope(
    principal="user:42",
    permissions=PermissionSet(["filesystem.read"]),
)
with execution_context(scope=scope):
    # Nested modules inherit filesystem.read, but cannot add filesystem.write.
    result = system(input_data)
```

This example grants an exact capability at the trusted application entry point.
An explicit child PermissionSet is intersected with the parent; an empty set
removes all grants. Nested executions cannot change principal. Omitted child
permissions inherit the parent's grants. Concurrent root executions are isolated.

`scope.to_dict()` serializes execution identity only, excluding principal and
grants. Restoring a checkpoint never restores authority: the application must
supply current grants on resume. Capability names have no wildcard semantics.
These grants are authorization metadata, not an operating-system sandbox.

## Approval journal (experimental)

`Store.approval(...)` records host-created approval requests and decisions. The
store alone does not pause or execute tools. To connect it to Agent checkpoints,
use [Agent approvals](#agent-approvals-experimental) below. Neither API adds
capabilities to the caller's live authority.

Available providers are `in_memory` (process-local) and `sqlite` (persistent,
including independent worker processes). Both use the same transition rules.

```python
import time
from uuid import uuid4

from msgflux.data.stores import Store
from msgflux.runtime import ApprovalBinding, ExecutionScope, PermissionSet, execution_context

store = Store.approval("sqlite", path=".msgflux/approvals.sqlite3")
request_id = uuid4().hex
binding = ApprovalBinding.from_call(
    namespace="catalog", thread_id="thread:42", run_id="run:1",
    principal="user:42", tool_call_id="call:1", tool_name="update_catalog",
    tool_revision="implementation:v1", policy_version="policy:v1",
    arguments={"sku": "ABC", "quantity": 3},
    resources={"catalog_id": "warehouse:1"},
    required_permissions=("catalog.write",),
)

try:
    requested = store.request(
        binding, request_id=request_id, expires_at=time.time() + 300,
    )
    pending = store.pending("catalog", "thread:42", "run:1")

    # Only after authenticating the reviewer and receiving their actual decision:
    decided = store.decide(
        "catalog", request_id, approved=True, decided_by="reviewer:7",
    )

    # The host must recompute the binding from the current invocation and policy.
    # This example retains the same binding because neither has changed.
    with execution_context(scope=ExecutionScope(
        namespace="catalog", thread_id="thread:42", run_id="run:1",
        principal="user:42", permissions=PermissionSet(["catalog.write"]),
    )):
        receipt = store.consume(request_id, binding=binding)

    audit = store.events("catalog", request_id)
finally:
    store.close()
```

This example creates a five-minute request, records a host-authenticated decision,
and consumes it once. It deliberately performs no external action. The journal
contains the `pending`, `approved`, and `consumed` revisions. A second consumption
raises `ApprovalConflictError`, even from another process. `approved=False`
records a terminal denial. Repeating the same request ID and binding/deadline or
the same decision/reviewer is idempotent; conflicting retries are rejected.

### Binding and authority

Bindings include execution identity, principal, tool-call identity, a host-owned
implementation revision, policy version, required capabilities, and SHA-256
digests of canonical public arguments and resource constraints. Any change needs
a new request; a request cannot be reused in another run or namespace. Argument
objects must contain JSON values with string keys: custom objects, tuples, and
non-finite numbers are rejected. Dictionary order does not change the digest.

The journal does not store original arguments, resource values, injected runtime
inputs, or a copy of the live grants. Keep invocation data in appropriately
protected application state when it is needed for review or resumption. Digests
are not encryption and may reveal low-entropy values through guessing; restrict
database access and avoid sensitive text in identifiers.

`consume` compares the supplied binding with the stored request and checks the
live principal, namespace, thread/run, and required capabilities. Approval alone
never widens authority. The host must recompute current arguments, resource
constraints and policy/implementation versions, authenticate reviewers, authorize
access to the journal, and enforce actual resource or sandbox restrictions.
Do not expose `decide` directly as a model tool or accept reviewer identity from
an unauthenticated request.

### Expiration, recovery, and async calls

Deadlines use absolute Unix seconds. `get`, `pending`, decision and consumption
operations record expiration when they encounter an elapsed pending/approved
request; no timer or background sweeper is installed. A recorded expiration
cannot be reversed by a clock rollback. The host owns clock correctness.
`ApprovalExpiredError` is a subclass of `ApprovalConflictError`.

SQLite commits the current record and its append-only audit revision in one
transaction. Reopening the database preserves decisions and used requests.
`pending` is a polling view, not a gap-free, atomic watcher snapshot; audit
revisions are per request, not cursors for the global execution stream. There is
no automatic journal retention or deletion policy in this API.

All operations have async counterparts: `arequest`, `aget`, `apending`, `adecide`,
`aconsume`, `aevents`, and `aclose`. They run storage operations in worker threads
and preserve execution context. For example, within the same live scope:

```python
receipt = await store.aconsume(request_id, binding=current_binding)
```

Use this **instead of** synchronous consumption for that request. It performs
the same binding and live-authority checks and does not execute the tool.

!!! warning "Consumption is not exactly-once execution"
    Cancelling an async wait does not undo an already committed transaction.
    A crash after consumption but before an external action leaves the request
    consumed. Do not automatically execute or retry an action merely because a
    record says `consumed`: external idempotency or reconciliation is still
    required. This API neither coordinates an Agent checkpoint transaction nor
    deduplicates every invocation across different approval request IDs.

## Agent approvals (experimental)

Pass `AgentApprovals` to an Agent to require host approval for named tools. The
`tools` mapping contains tool names and host-owned implementation revisions;
`policy_version` identifies your current approval policy. Increment these
versions when the implementation or policy changes. They are not inferred from
Python source code.

The following example assumes `model` is your configured chat-completion model.
The demonstration tool returns a string; it performs no external write.

```python
from msgflux.data.stores import Store
from msgflux.exceptions import TaskPauseRequestedError
from msgflux.nn import Agent
from msgflux.runtime import AgentApprovals, ExecutionScope, PermissionSet
from msgflux.tools.config import tool_config


@tool_config(required_permissions=["catalog.write"], retry=False)
def publish(sku: str) -> str:
    """Publish a catalog entry."""
    return f"Published {sku}"


checkpoints = Store.checkpoint("sqlite", path=".msgflux/checkpoints.sqlite3")
journal = Store.approval("sqlite", path=".msgflux/approvals.sqlite3")
agent = Agent(
    name="publisher", model=model, tools=[publish], checkpoint_store=checkpoints,
    approvals=AgentApprovals(
        store=journal, tools={"publish": "implementation:v1"},
        policy_version="policy:v1", ttl_seconds=300,
    ),
)
scope = ExecutionScope(
    namespace="publisher", thread_id="catalog:42", run_id="publication:1",
    principal="user:42", permissions=PermissionSet(["catalog.write"]),
)

try:
    result = agent("Publish SKU ABC", scope=scope)
except TaskPauseRequestedError:
    requests = journal.pending("publisher", "catalog:42", "publication:1")
    # Present these requests through your authenticated host UI.
```

When the model requests `publish`, the Agent checkpoints the pending tool-call
batch and raises `TaskPauseRequestedError`. No tool in that batch runs yet,
including siblings that do not require approval. The checkpoint retains the
original public arguments and call IDs; the journal retains their digests.
Protect both stores according to their contents.

After the host has authenticated the reviewer, authorized their access to the
request and received an actual decision, it can record that decision:

```python
agent.decide_approval(
    request_id, approved=reviewer_approved, decided_by=authenticated_reviewer_id,
)
result = agent("", scope=scope)
```

Use the `request_id` returned in `requests` or a watcher snapshot. The second
call resumes the **same** namespace, thread and run; its message is ignored.
Pending calls are replayed before requesting another model response and without
duplicating the original call history. Repeated resumes while decisions remain
pending simply pause again. The model may request another protected call later,
so the host should handle subsequent pauses too.

An approval is consumed at foreground executor entry, after checking the final
public arguments and dispatch plan. Hooks cannot alter a call and reuse its old
approval. Declared capabilities and the live principal are checked again;
checkpoint restoration never restores grants. Supply live runtime inputs again
on resume, as for other Agent checkpoints.

### Choosing when to ask for approval

Approval is host policy, not a property of `BashTool` or its native transport.
For new runs that should execute without confirmation prompts, omit `approvals`
or pass `approvals=None`:

```python
from msgflux.nn import Agent
from msgflux.tools.builtin import BashTool

agent = Agent(
    name="workspace", model=model, tools=[BashTool()],
    checkpoint_store=checkpoints, approvals=None,
)
```

This disables approval prompts, not sandboxing or authorization. Supply an
`ExecutionScope` with an authorized `ExecutionEnvironment`, `process.execute`,
and the necessary resource grants. There is no implicit wildcard/full-access
grant. If your application's UI calls this mode “full access”, define its live
grants separately. For selective approval, configure `AgentApprovals.tools` with
only the names that need confirmation; omit `bash` to let it execute
without a prompt. An empty mapping is not accepted; use `approvals=None` instead.
An unprotected sibling still waits when another call in its batch needs approval.

### Overriding approvals per invocation

`forward`/`aforward` accept `approvals` as a keyword-only runtime override, also
available through `agent(...)`, `agent.acall(...)` and `agent.stream_events(...)`.
Omitting it uses the configured default; passing `None` explicitly disables
prompts for new batches. Passing an `AgentApprovals` instance replaces the default
for that invocation only, including when the constructor default is `None`.

```python
from msgflux.runtime import AgentApprovals

policy = AgentApprovals(
    store=journal, tools={"bash": "implementation:v1"},
    policy_version="interactive:v1",
)

# The workspace agent above has approvals=None by default.
try:
    result = await agent.acall("Run the checks", scope=scope, approvals=policy)
except TaskPauseRequestedError:
    # Display requests; wait for an authenticated user's decision.
    pass
```

This invocation requires approval for Bash without changing `agent.approvals`.
Use `approvals=None` explicitly for an invocation without prompts, or omit the
keyword to use the constructor default. The policy is held in execution-local
context, not shared mutable Agent state or model inputs. Concurrent calls may
use different policies. The override is not saved as a live object in checkpoints.

Pass the policy again when observing, deciding and resuming a runtime-only policy:

```python
async with agent.watch(scope.thread_id, approvals=policy) as watcher:
    requests = watcher.snapshot.approvals
    # Render these records and obtain a decision outside this example.

await agent.adecide_approval(
    request_id, approved=reviewer_approved, decided_by=authenticated_reviewer_id,
    approvals=policy,
)
result = await agent.acall("", scope=scope, approvals=policy)
```

The second example assumes the host has selected a request and authenticated the
reviewer. Synchronous applications use `decide_approval(..., approvals=policy)`
and `agent(..., approvals=policy)`. Watchers retain the policy selected when they
are created; changing the mode in the UI does not reconfigure an existing watcher.

The override is selected at invocation entry, not by mutating a running loop.
To change modes during a conversation, serialize the UI's operations and pass the
new policy on the next invocation or safe resume boundary. Permissions remain
separate: supply their current values in the live `ExecutionScope` on each call.
Do not remove a policy to bypass an already-pending approval. Pending requests
retain their binding and must be resolved under the original policy; uncertain
executing batches require host reconciliation.

### Async execution and observation

Use `agent.acall(...)` and `agent.adecide_approval(...)` for async applications.
They share the same approval state machine. `stream_events(...)` yields
`tool.approval_required` and `run.paused` before ending with
`TaskPauseRequestedError`; catch the
exception around the async iteration. The event identifies the request and tool
call without including its arguments.

Reconnect after a pause, including after recreating the Agent with the same
SQLite stores and policy:

```python
async with agent.watch("catalog:42") as watcher:
    requests = watcher.snapshot.approvals
    # Render request IDs, status, deadline and tool identity in the host UI.
```

`snapshot.approvals` contains journal records referenced by the latest run's
pending batch. They may be pending, decided, expired, or consumed-but-unsettled.
`decide_approval` emits `tool.approval_resolved` to live watchers in this process;
direct `journal.decide` only updates storage. A decision never automatically
restarts the Agent. Cross-process live events and an atomic snapshot spanning
the checkpoint and journal databases are not provided; reconnect or poll storage
to refresh external decisions.

### Connecting a TUI

Run event consumption in an async task so the UI stays responsive. For example,
with the approval-enabled `agent`, `journal`, and `scope` above:

```python
import asyncio

from msgflux.exceptions import TaskPauseRequestedError
from msgflux.runtime.approvals.agent import ApprovalReconciliationRequiredError


async def run_turn(message):
    try:
        async for event in agent.stream_events(message, scope=scope):
            render_event(event)
    except ApprovalReconciliationRequiredError:
        show_recovery_required()
    except TaskPauseRequestedError:
        requests = await asyncio.to_thread(
            journal.pending, scope.namespace, scope.thread_id, scope.run_id,
        )
        show_approval_requests(requests)


async def answer_request(request_id, approved, reviewer_id):
    await agent.adecide_approval(
        request_id, approved=approved, decided_by=reviewer_id,
    )
    await run_turn("")
```

`render_event`, `show_recovery_required`, and `show_approval_requests` are your
UI functions. Schedule `run_turn(prompt)` as a task in the TUI event loop. Call
`answer_request` only after that task has ended, from an explicit authenticated
user action; serialize submissions so only one worker resumes a run at a time.
Keep the same scope and re-supply live dependencies. A decision alone does not
resume execution. If other requests remain pending, the resumed call pauses again.

The approval event and journal intentionally omit raw arguments. To display the
exact command batch, the authorized host can read the checkpoint through
`await agent.ainspect_approval_batch(scope.thread_id, scope.run_id)` and correlate
its pending intents by tool-call ID. Treat those arguments as untrusted display
data, including terminal escape sequences. Use `agent.watch(...)` and its snapshot
when reconnecting; live events alone are not a durable approval queue. Other
extensions can also pause an Agent, so an empty approval list is not permission
to automatically resume it.

### Denial, timeout, and recovery

Denied or expired approvals become blocked tool observations on the next resume;
the model can continue without executing those calls. Deadline checks are lazy:
there is no timer that resumes a paused Agent automatically. Removing a pending
rule or changing its binding leaves the run paused for host reconciliation.

Before dispatch, the Agent atomically checkpoints the batch as `executing`.
Only a checkpoint containing the results clears that marker. A restart that
finds `executing`, or an already consumed approval without results, **does not
retry any tool in the batch**. The host must inspect external effects and
reconcile the run using the host API below. Starting a
new run is not a safe substitute unless the host has established that replaying
the action is safe. Existing tool retry settings still apply within a single
invocation; use explicit idempotency where external effects require it.

An `executing` batch raises `ApprovalReconciliationRequiredError`, a subclass
of `TaskPauseRequestedError`, without changing the checkpoint. The original
worker may still be active: wait for it before treating the state as a crash.
This prevents a competing resume from invalidating that worker's commit.

!!! warning "Supported boundary"
    This integration requires atomic checkpoints and canonical foreground
    ToolLibrary calls, including canonical Chat Completions and Responses tool
    responses. Detached/background approval dispatch, flow-control DSL tools,
    provider-hosted effects and resource-scoped sandbox policies are unsupported.
    Nested protected calls without their own approved batch are blocked.
    The Agent policy binds declared static resource requirements and, when an
    environment is present, its workspace ID and isolation requirements. Public
    arguments and host policy/tool versions remain part of the binding. It does
    not infer every resource accessed by arbitrary Python or a shell command.

    Policies, context injectors, dispatchers and raw Python implementations are
    trusted host code. Agent approval rules do not protect arbitrary direct
    Python or standalone ToolLibrary calls outside that Agent execution.
    Do not expose the decision method as a model tool. Keep the policy and stores
    configured throughout the run; they are live host dependencies, not objects
    reconstructed from the checkpoint.

### Host reconciliation

Recovery is covered by an offline process-level conformance gate: independent
workers pause for approval, restart, perform a test effect, die before saving its
result, refuse automatic replay, reconcile and reconnect a commit observer.
The suite also checks legacy checkpoint upgrades and transaction rollback after
abrupt process loss. These tests do not imply exactly-once external execution or
power-loss guarantees for the underlying filesystem.

Stop the old worker and verify external effects before reconciling. The runtime
cannot prove worker quiescence or undo an external write. These methods are
host-only: authenticate the operator and authorize access to the run yourself.
Never expose them as model tools.

```python
state = agent.inspect_approval_batch("catalog:42", "publication:1")
receipt = agent.reconcile_approval_batch(
    "catalog:42", "publication:1",
    expected_revision=state["_checkpoint"]["revision"],
    decision_id="incident:123", decided_by=authenticated_reviewer_id,
    reason="Verified the catalog entry in the external system",
    worker_stopped=True,
    results={"call_123": "Published ABC; verified by the operator"},
)
result = agent("", scope=scope)
```

Replace `call_123` with the pending call ID. Supply confirmed text observations
for **every** call in `state["runtime"]["extensions"]["pending_approvals"]["intents"]`,
including unprotected siblings. This atomically appends outputs, clears the
pending batch, saves a receipt and appends `approval.reconciled` to checkpoint
events. Resume requests the model without executing those tools again. This
initial API accepts text observations, not runtime commands or artifact objects.

To stop instead, omit `results` and pass `abandon=True`. The run becomes
`interrupted`; observations explicitly report unconfirmed effects, not success.
This does not undo effects or authorize replay in another run.

An identical `decision_id` and payload returns the original receipt; a conflicting
reuse or stale revision raises `CheckpointConflictError`. Concurrent callers may
retry the identical decision after a conflict. Revision checks fence old
checkpoint writes, **not** external tool execution. Receipts include the reason
and confirmed results: protect checkpoint access accordingly. Approval journal
records remain unchanged, preserving their original execution evidence.

`ainspect_approval_batch` and `areconcile_approval_batch` are async mirrors. A
cancelled await may leave an already-started storage transaction committed;
retry the same decision ID to discover its outcome safely.

Cancellation has two distinct cases. An exception raised **inside** a SQLite
transaction rolls back before the connection is reused. Cancelling an async
caller while a worker thread is committing does not stop that thread: the write
may still succeed. After an uncertain outcome, inspect committed state and use
the original decision ID/revision instead of assuming rollback or replaying a
tool. A stale checkpoint revision must fail, not overwrite the winner.

## Workspaces and execution environments (experimental)

`ExecutionEnvironment` supplies live execution dependencies: a virtual filesystem
and an optional `ProcessExecutor`. `ExecutionScope.permissions` remains the only
source of grants. Child executions inherit the same environment and may narrow
permissions, but cannot replace the environment. Checkpoint identity serialization
omits both environment and authority; supply them again on resume.

### Virtual files and live resource grants

`InMemoryWorkspace` implements `WorkspaceFilesystem` without accessing the host
filesystem. Its initial files are supplied by trusted host code. Runtime operations
require exact resource/action grants and an active scope bound to that filesystem.

```python
from msgflux.runtime import (
    ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope, InMemoryWorkspace, PermissionSet,
    execution_context,
)

filesystem = InMemoryWorkspace(
    "project-42", {"/workspace/report.txt": b"Quarterly report"},
)
environment = ExecutionEnvironment(filesystem)
scope = ExecutionScope(
    principal="user:42", environment=environment,
    permissions=PermissionSet(resources=[
        filesystem.permission("/workspace/report.txt", "filesystem.read"),
        filesystem.permission("/workspace/output.txt", "filesystem.write"),
        filesystem.permission("/workspace", "filesystem.list"),
    ]),
)

with execution_context(scope=scope):
    text = filesystem.read_text("/workspace/report.txt")
    filesystem.write_text("/workspace/output.txt", text.upper())
    names = filesystem.listdir("/workspace")
```

This reads one authorized file, writes another, and lists the directory. A write
grant does not imply read access. A directory-list grant exposes child names, not
child contents or recursive access. Resource IDs include the workspace ID and
canonical virtual path; keep workspace IDs unique and stable within your host.

Operations are `read_bytes`/`read_text`, `write_bytes`/`write_text`, `listdir`,
`mkdir` and `unlink`, with async counterparts prefixed by `a`. Grants use
`filesystem.read`, `filesystem.write`, `filesystem.list`, `filesystem.mkdir` and
`filesystem.delete`, respectively. Writes create or replace a file in an existing
parent directory. `mkdir` creates one directory; `unlink` deletes files only.
The host's initial file map creates the required parent directories.

Paths are absolute POSIX paths inside the workspace, independent of the host OS.
Dot/repeated-separator aliases are canonicalized; `..`, backslashes, control
characters and leading `//` are rejected. There are no symlinks, host mounts or
implicit path-containment grants. Use `filesystem.permission(...)` to construct
the same resource identity used by operations. Grants are checked on each
operation, including when an injected handle is reused under a narrower scope.

### Preparing file changes for review

`WorkspaceEditor` is the shared host backend for text writes, exact edits and
deletions. It prepares an immutable `PreparedFileChange` without modifying the
file. The proposal contains the workspace identity, canonical path, exact old and
new text (`None` means absent), a schema version, and computed `operation`,
`digest` and unified `diff` properties. All new contracts use `msgspec.Struct`.
An empty file is distinct from an absent file. Review diffs preserve newline
differences and mark missing final newlines; empty-file creation/deletion still
has source/target headers.

```python
import time
from uuid import uuid4

import msgspec

from msgflux.runtime import (
    ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope, InMemoryApprovalStore,
    InMemoryWorkspace, PermissionSet, WorkspaceEditor, execution_context,
)

filesystem = InMemoryWorkspace("project", {"/config.txt": b"mode=old\n"})
editor = WorkspaceEditor(filesystem)  # approval required by default
journal = InMemoryApprovalStore()
scope = ExecutionScope(
    namespace="editor", thread_id="thread:1", run_id="run:1", principal="user:1",
    environment=ExecutionEnvironment(filesystem),
    permissions=PermissionSet(resources=[
        filesystem.permission("/config.txt", "filesystem.read"),
        filesystem.permission("/config.txt", "filesystem.write"),
    ]),
)

with execution_context(scope=scope):
    change = editor.prepare_edit("/config.txt", "mode=old", "mode=new")
    binding = editor.approval_binding(
        change, tool_call_id="call:1", tool_name="edit",
        tool_revision="v1", policy_version="review:v1",
    )
    record = journal.request(
        binding, request_id=uuid4().hex, expires_at=time.time() + 300,
    )
    checkpoint_payload = msgspec.to_builtins(change)
    # Persist checkpoint_payload and record.request_id in host-owned state.
    # Present change.path, change.operation and change.diff in an authenticated UI.

# Later, ONLY after the authenticated reviewer actually approves that preview:
journal.decide("editor", record.request_id, approved=True, decided_by="reviewer:1")
with execution_context(scope=scope):
    restored = msgspec.convert(checkpoint_payload, type=type(change))
    editor.apply(restored, approval=record, approval_store=journal)
```

This example binds the approval to the exact proposal and execution identity,
then consumes the journal decision before applying it. The record returned at
request time is just an identifier/binding snapshot: `apply` consults the journal
for the current decision, so pending, denied, expired or already consumed records
cannot authorize a write. Modified proposals cannot use the original approval.
The host must also enforce its current implementation/policy versions before
resuming; this low-level API does not discover policy revisions automatically.

`prepare_write(path, content)` creates or overwrites text;
`prepare_edit(path, old, new)` requires exactly one match, including overlapping
matches, and never guesses whitespace; `prepare_delete(path)` includes the deleted
text in the proposal. No-op proposals and non-UTF-8 files are rejected. The async
counterparts are `aprepare_write`, `aprepare_edit`, `aprepare_delete` and `aapply`.

Preparation and application require live read and write (or delete) grants for
the exact path. Previews expose existing contents, so read permission is required
even when creating/overwriting. `WorkspaceEditor(..., require_approval=False)` is
an explicit host full-access choice; it disables confirmation, not permissions
or conflict checks. Prepared objects never restore execution authority.

By default application uses `WorkspaceFilesystem.compare_exchange`: comparison and mutation
are atomic **per file**, with `None` representing expected absence. Backends must
opt in with `supports_atomic_changes = True` and implement `_compare_exchange`
against all concurrent writers, including path/symlink substitution. The memory
backend uses its shared lock. Unsupported backends fail closed; there is no
read-then-write fallback or multi-file transaction. The local backend below uses
an explicitly selected weaker guarantee, never this atomic contract.
The precondition checks exact contents, not whether an identical file was edited
and restored in the meantime.

!!! warning "Approval and file application are separate transactions"

    A changed file raises `WorkspaceConflictError`. If another writer races after
    approval consumption, the atomic check still prevents overwriting its work,
    but the approval remains consumed. A crash or async cancellation may also
    leave the application outcome uncertain. Reconcile with the live backend;
    never automatically replay a consumed approval or regenerate a different
    patch under the old decision. The memory backend is not persistent storage.

The journal remains argument-free. The host persists proposals in its protected
checkpoint/artifact storage and exposes them only to authorized reviewers, not
global events. Escape terminal/HTML controls when rendering the diff, display the
operation and exact path separately, and allow inspection of the complete change.
This initial backend stores full old/new text; large-file artifact storage and
preview paging are not implemented yet. Do not inject these previews into model
context just to render a UI. This low-level API does not implicitly register a
tool. The Agent integration below uses the same prepared-change and atomic-write
contracts, with Agent-owned approval consumption.

### Local files on the host

`LocalWorkspaceBackend(root)` maps virtual `/` to an existing absolute directory
on the host. Unlike `InMemoryWorkspaceBackend`, writes modify real files; closing
a binding does not delete or roll back them. This backend requires POSIX
descriptor-relative operations and fails explicitly on unsupported platforms.
It supplies no shell executor or network service. Repeated `open` calls for the
same id share the existing files and identity, with independent binding lifecycle.
Different ids on this backend still address the same root, not isolated copies.
Use different directories/backends when file isolation between sessions is needed.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from msgflux.runtime import (
    ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope, LocalWorkspaceBackend,
    PermissionSet, execution_context,
)

async def update_local_file(root: Path):
    backend = LocalWorkspaceBackend(root)
    async with await backend.open("project") as binding:
        fs = binding.filesystem
        environment = ExecutionEnvironment.from_binding(
            binding, write_guarantee="cooperative_compare",
        )
        permissions = PermissionSet(resources=[
            fs.permission("/notes.txt", "filesystem.read"),
            fs.permission("/notes.txt", "filesystem.write"),
        ])
        with execution_context(scope=ExecutionScope(
            environment=environment, permissions=permissions,
        )):
            editor = environment.workspace_editor(require_approval=False)
            change = await editor.aprepare_write("/notes.txt", "Updated locally\n")
            print(change.diff)
            await editor.aapply(change)
```

Call this function with an explicitly selected existing absolute directory. It
prepares a diff and changes only `notes.txt` under that directory. This example
disables approval prompts as a host decision, but does not bypass permissions.
For user-reviewed writes, keep `require_approval=True` (the default) and use the
approval request/decision/application flow described above. Review records remain
bound to the exact resource, content and write guarantee.

Local writes require explicit `cooperative_compare`: cooperating operations on
the same filesystem/backend are serialized and recheck the expected bytes before
replacement. The default `atomic_compare` is deliberately rejected. An editor or
another process can still modify a file between comparison and replacement.
The host selects this policy on `ExecutionEnvironment`, and file tools use it
for both preparation and application. It is not a model-visible argument and is
never inferred automatically from the selected backend.

Paths remain virtual absolute POSIX paths, not arbitrary host paths. Parent
directories must exist. Symlinks, hardlinked files and special files are rejected;
directory traversal does not follow symlinks. Pagination uses bounded memory,
although reaching a large line offset still requires scanning preceding bytes.
Opening an existing local resource is not a snapshot. Reconnection verifies the
exact identity retained by this backend instance; a new process/backend requires
a fresh resource identity and review, even when the files remain on disk.

!!! warning "Trusted local workspace, not an OS sandbox"
    Do not use this backend to isolate hostile code or concurrent hostile host
    processes. It cannot mediate host Python, subprocesses or network access.
    External directory moves and same-device mounts are outside its containment
    guarantees. A replaced root directory is rejected. File replacement changes
    the inode; ordinary permission bits may be preserved, but ownership, ACLs,
    extended attributes and hardlink relationships are not preserved as a general
    contract. Atomic replacement is not a power-loss durability guarantee. See
    [Python's file replacement semantics](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/os.html#os.replace).

### One tool library, different workspace backends

`WriteTool`, `EditTool` and `ApplyPatchTool` use the same environment-owned editor
factory. `ReadFileTool` continues to use the filesystem's bounded read interface.
Changing the backend does not change tool names, argument schemas, return values
or provider transports. Only the host's resource binding and required guarantee
change. The strict default also permits reading a local workspace; it rejects
mutation when the editor is requested, rather than rejecting the whole environment.

```python
from msgflux.nn import ToolLibrary
from msgflux.runtime import ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope, PermissionSet, execution_context
from msgflux.tools.builtin import ApplyPatchTool, EditTool, ReadFileTool, WriteTool

tools = ToolLibrary("workspace", [ReadFileTool(), WriteTool(), EditTool(), ApplyPatchTool()])

async def exercise_workspace(backend, *, write_guarantee="atomic_compare"):
    async with await backend.open("project") as binding:
        fs = binding.filesystem
        environment = ExecutionEnvironment.from_binding(
            binding, write_guarantee=write_guarantee,
        )
        scope = ExecutionScope(
            environment=environment,
            permissions=PermissionSet(resources=[
                fs.permission("/notes.txt", f"filesystem.{action}")
                for action in ("read", "write")
            ]),
        )
        with execution_context(scope=scope):
            await tools.arun("write", {"path": "notes.txt", "content": "first\nsecond\n"})
            await tools.arun("edit", {"path": "notes.txt", "old": "second", "new": "last"})
            return await tools.arun("read", {"path": "notes.txt", "offset": 2, "limit": 1})
```

With `InMemoryWorkspaceBackend()`, this function uses its default atomic guarantee.
With `LocalWorkspaceBackend(root)`, pass `write_guarantee="cooperative_compare"`.
Both return `"last\n"`; the latter modifies the selected real `notes.txt`.
This direct `ToolLibrary` example does not request user approval. In an Agent,
register the same tools and configure `AgentApprovals` for `write`, `edit` and
`apply_patch` to require reviewed diffs, using the existing pause/decision/resume
flow. Permissions remain required regardless of approval settings.

`ExecutionEnvironment(..., write_guarantee=...)` also supports directly supplied,
unmanaged filesystems. The field is immutable and keyword-only. Its
`workspace_editor(require_approval=True)` method can also be used by host code;
the default low-level editor still requires an approval record. Directly constructing
`WorkspaceEditor` remains a separate explicit host API and does not inherit an
environment's policy implicitly.

Prepared changes already persist the selected guarantee, and their digest is
bound to Agent approval. Changing the guarantee between preview and execution
invalidates that review; it is never adopted from a saved proposal as authority.
Supply a new environment only at a top-level invocation boundary; nested scopes
cannot replace it. Reconcile pending work and obtain a new review when changing
policy. No prompt or checkpoint field grants filesystem access by itself.

### Dynamic workspace guidance

`WorkspacePromptExtension` is an opt-in system-prompt extension. It reads the
live execution scope each time the Agent composes a model request, including
sync/async calls and prompt warmup. It appends one bounded `<workspace_context>`
section to the existing prompt; it does not modify the Agent's base prompt or
store permissions in extension state. A run without an environment adds nothing.

```python
from msgflux.nn import Agent
from msgflux.nn.extensions import WorkspacePromptExtension
from msgflux.runtime import ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope, LocalWorkspaceBackend, PermissionSet
from msgflux.tools.builtin import EditTool, ReadFileTool

# `model` is your configured chat model; `root` is your selected absolute directory.
agent = Agent(
    name="workspace_assistant", model=model,
    system_prompt="Help maintain this project.",
    tools=[ReadFileTool(), EditTool()],
    extensions=[WorkspacePromptExtension(max_resources=20, max_chars=6000)],
)

async def ask_about_file(root):
    backend = LocalWorkspaceBackend(root)
    async with await backend.open("project") as binding:
        fs = binding.filesystem
        scope = ExecutionScope(
            environment=ExecutionEnvironment.from_binding(
                binding, write_guarantee="cooperative_compare",
            ),
            permissions=PermissionSet(resources=[
                fs.permission("/notes.txt", "filesystem.read"),
            ]),
        )
        return await agent.acall("Summarize notes.txt", scope=scope)
```

This example allows only reading `notes.txt`. The prompt reports that local writes
would affect real files, but does not grant them: `EditTool` still fails without
a write grant. Approvals are configured separately using `AgentApprovals`; the
extension does not claim that approval is enabled or replace the approval flow.
With memory or another backend, the same extension uses that backend's description.

The section contains backend-declared storage behavior and guidance, virtual path
rules, the required write guarantee and declared write capabilities, and a bounded
list of exact filesystem grants for the current workspace. Relative paths use
each tool's configured `cwd`; there is no invented global working directory.
When a process executor exists, its declared isolation mechanisms and the live
`process.execute` grant are reported separately from required isolation. This is
not proof of sandboxing or a description of network policy, including host traffic
to the model. Tool availability still depends on the current tool catalog.

`max_resources` limits the number of paths shown (default 20); zero hides all path
entries. `max_chars` bounds the entire added section (default 6000), not the base
system prompt. Entries are removed whole to fit, with an `omitted_resources` count.
An omitted path is not necessarily denied. If even the description without path
entries exceeds the budget, rendering fails explicitly rather than truncating
instructions or presenting an incomplete path as an exact grant.

Backends declare a `WorkspacePromptInfo(storage=..., guidance=...)` on their
`prompt_info` attribute/property. It is an immutable `msgspec.Struct`, separate
from resource identity, capabilities and credentials. Memory and local backends
provide defaults; unknown backends report unspecified storage. Custom descriptions
must be trusted host-owned text: never populate them from file contents, tool
outputs or model messages, and do not include private host paths or credentials.
Changing a description does not change backend enforcement.

No files are opened or discovered to build the prompt. Default descriptions omit
physical roots, backend connection identifiers and unrelated resource grants.
Workspace path grants are model-visible when this extension is enabled; use
`max_resources=0` when even virtual filenames should be withheld. A closed binding
is rejected. On resume or a new invocation the section is recalculated from live
dependencies; prior prompt text is not used to recover authority or resource state.

The separate **local harness** is an end-to-end validation script configured with
a real directory. It exercises Agent calls, events, file tools, approvals and
resume behavior; it is not another runtime or a sandbox. Adapting the existing
validation script to that mode is a later increment, not part of this extension.

### Backend factories and live bindings

`WorkspaceBackend` is a reusable host service. Its asynchronous `open()` creates
a `WorkspaceBinding` for one resource; `reconnect()` opens a new binding only
after verifying the exact resource identity. Backend instances may share client
pools or implementations, but do not carry execution-local grants, principals
or conversation state.

`ExecutionEnvironment.from_binding()` connects the existing runtime and tools to
the binding's filesystem and optional process executor. It validates service
identity and requested executor capabilities. Execution still checks live grants,
abort signals and executor compatibility on every call. Direct construction of
`ExecutionEnvironment(filesystem, ...)` remains available for unmanaged filesystems.
Once a filesystem is attached to a binding, it requires an active binding for all
runtime-mediated access. Removing `binding` from an environment or wrapping the
same filesystem in an unmanaged environment does not restore access; preexisting
unmanaged environments are also rejected on subsequent use of that resource.

```python
import asyncio

from msgflux.runtime import (
    ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope, InMemoryWorkspaceBackend,
    PermissionSet, execution_context,
)

async def main():
    backend = InMemoryWorkspaceBackend({"/note.txt": b"original"})
    binding = await backend.open("project")
    identity = binding.identity

    async with binding:
        environment = ExecutionEnvironment.from_binding(binding)
        fs = binding.filesystem
        scope = ExecutionScope(
            environment=environment,
            permissions=PermissionSet(resources=[
                fs.permission("/note.txt", "filesystem.read"),
                fs.permission("/note.txt", "filesystem.write"),
            ]),
        )
        with execution_context(scope=scope):
            fs.write_text("/note.txt", "updated")
            assert fs.read_text("/note.txt") == "updated"

    # Closing detached this connection; it did not delete the resource.
    async with await backend.reconnect("project", identity) as reconnected:
        assert reconnected.identity == identity
        # Create a fresh environment and grant authority explicitly to use it.

asyncio.run(main())
```

This example uses only memory. Every `open()` creates independent files, even
when passed the same workspace name. Reconnection shares the existing files, not
the original execution scope or permissions. Resources are retained for the
lifetime of the memory backend and its bindings; there is no cross-process
recovery or implicit eviction. Closing one binding does not close other bindings
to the same resource. A new backend instance cannot reconnect to resources owned
by an earlier instance.

Bindings are live, non-serializable objects. Persist only their identity, then
have the host resolve the backend and reconnect. An expired/missing resource is
an error, not permission to create a replacement under an old approval. Nested
execution still cannot replace its environment; inherit the parent environment
rather than constructing another one inside a tool.

`await binding.aclose()` releases the connection through the backend's `_release`
hook. Successful close is idempotent and also runs on async context-manager exit.
The `ownership` label (`owned` or `borrowed`) records provenance only: neither
mode implicitly deletes files, terminates a sandbox or authorizes destruction.
No destroy/pause/snapshot capability is implemented in this increment.

| Binding state | Access and cleanup |
| --- | --- |
| `open` | Mediated operations are allowed subject to live permissions |
| `closing` | New mediated operations are rejected while release runs |
| `closed` | Access is rejected; repeated close is harmless |
| `release_failed` | Access is rejected; host reconciliation is required before any further cleanup |

!!! warning "Connection release is not process cancellation"

    Drain or cancel active operations before closing a binding. Closing gates
    new runtime-mediated operations, but cannot roll back writes or guarantee
    termination of already running remote processes. If release fails or is
    cancelled, the binding becomes `release_failed` and does not automatically
    retry unknown effects. Backend adapters must clean up partial connections
    when open/reconnect fails or is cancelled. Use bindings within one async
    event loop; they are not designed for concurrent use across event loops.

The `WorkspaceBackend` ABC defines `open`, optional `reconnect` (unsupported by
default) and `_release`. Vendor adapters return the same binding type, backed by
their own filesystem and executor implementations. A remote executor must operate
on the same files as that filesystem: mounting or synchronizing local files is a
separate explicit integration, not inferred from matching path strings. The
reference memory backend provides no process executor, network access or host
filesystem access.

### Resource identity and write guarantees

`workspace_id` names a logical workspace; it does not identify the underlying
files. Every filesystem also exposes an immutable `WorkspaceIdentity` containing
`backend`, `resource_id`, `generation` and `config_revision`. Prepared changes and
Agent approval bindings include this identity. Replacing a resource, recreating
an in-memory filesystem, or changing the configuration revision invalidates the
old review even if the workspace name and file contents are identical.

```python
import msgspec
from msgflux.runtime import InMemoryWorkspace, WorkspaceIdentity

first = InMemoryWorkspace("project")
replacement = InMemoryWorkspace("project")
assert first.identity != replacement.identity

encoded = msgspec.json.encode(first.identity)
descriptor = msgspec.json.decode(encoded, type=WorkspaceIdentity)
assert descriptor == first.identity
```

The example serializes a descriptor, not the files or a capability to access them.
A persistent adapter may pass a host-verified `identity=` to the
`WorkspaceFilesystem` constructor when reconnecting to the **same** resource.
It must change `generation` when that resource is replaced and `config_revision`
when its mount/security configuration changes. Never accept identity or
credentials from model arguments; the descriptor does not create a sandbox or
restore permissions. Existing adapters that omit identity receive a fresh
generation per instance and therefore require new approval after reconstruction.

`WorkspaceWriteCapabilities` keeps three declarations separate:

| Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `atomic_replace` | Single-file replacement without a partially visible replacement; no comparison guarantee |
| `cooperative_compare` | Comparison and mutation coordinated among backend participants; external writers can still race |
| `atomic_compare` | Comparison and mutation indivisible for all writers in the backend's resource model |

Atomic comparison satisfies a cooperative request, never the reverse.
`compare_exchange` retains its strict contract. The new `checked_replace` and
`achecked_replace` APIs select a guarantee explicitly and have no implicit
read-then-write fallback. A cooperative adapter declares its capabilities and
implements `_checked_replace`; it must recheck live authority after waiting for
its lock and coordinate all participating adapters sharing the same resource.
These declarations do not establish OS isolation, crash durability or a
multi-file transaction.

```python
from msgflux.runtime import WorkspaceEditor

# `filesystem` is a host-provided backend; this does not weaken its capabilities.
editor = WorkspaceEditor(filesystem, write_guarantee="cooperative_compare")
```

This is an explicit low-level host choice for a cooperative backend. Approval
remains required, and the selected guarantee is included in the proposal and
approval binding. Preparation rejects an unsupported guarantee; applying a
proposal through an editor with a different guarantee also fails. The builtin
write/edit/apply-patch tools obtain their guarantee from the live environment;
its default remains atomic comparison. These descriptors are independent of the
memory and local backend implementations described above.

!!! warning "Previously prepared changes need a fresh review"

    Old serialized proposals without `workspace_identity` remain readable for
    audit and diff display, but cannot be applied. Prepare a new proposal and
    obtain a new approval. Never add the current identity to an old approved
    proposal to bypass this check. Existing approval bindings also change, so
    pending Agent reviews may require host intervention after upgrading.

### Write, edit and delete tools with Agent previews

The environment's host-only `max_edit_bytes` defaults to 1,000,000 bytes per
old/new file. Editors read at most that budget plus one byte before decoding,
and reject oversized contents before preparing or applying changes. This also
applies to restored approval proposals. It bounds individual inputs, not the
aggregate memory of concurrent calls or all retained checkpoints.

```python
environment = ExecutionEnvironment(
    filesystem=filesystem,
    write_guarantee="cooperative_compare",  # for LocalWorkspace
    max_edit_bytes=256 * 1024,
)
reader = ReadFileTool(supports_vision=True, max_image_bytes=1_000_000)
```

This permits edits up to 256 KiB and images up to 1 MB without reading an
arbitrarily large file first. `ReadFileTool` rejects disabled vision before file
I/O. These host settings do not add parameters to the model-facing tool schemas.

Backend authors must implement bounded `_scandir(path, max_entries)` and
`_read_prefix(path, max_bytes)` hooks. The public `scandir`/`ascandir` methods
return sorted `WorkspaceEntry` values (`name`, `kind`), where `kind` is `file`,
`directory` or `other`. Exceeding the entry limit raises instead of silently
returning an incomplete directory. `read_prefix`/`aread_prefix` read at most the
requested bytes. Both APIs enforce live resource grants. There is no fallback
that reads the complete file or directory and slices it afterward.

Local enumeration never follows symbolic links. Links, multiply-linked files,
special files and cross-mount entries are classified as `other`, not safe files
to traverse. These checks do not turn the local backend into an OS sandbox.

`WriteTool(cwd="/")` exposes only `path` and `content`; `EditTool(cwd="/")`
exposes only `path`, `old` and `new`. Both are class-based tools with explicit
public annotations and `Write`/`Edit` display names. `DeleteTool(cwd="/")`
exposes only `path`, with display name `Delete`. It deletes one UTF-8 file or
one empty directory; binary files and recursive directory deletion are not
supported. The workspace root and symlinks are always rejected. Removed text
is included in the approval diff and compared again before deletion.
Directory previews have `target_kind="empty_directory"`, an opaque
`directory_token`, `before=None`, `after=None`, and a human-readable `diff`.
The token is checkpointed with the proposal and binds approval to that directory
incarnation. Replacement or newly added contents prevent deletion.
The filesystem is injected
from the live environment, and cwd is a constructor-only virtual path. Outputs
are compact JSON objects such as `{"status":"completed"}`; previews and old
file contents are not added to model history. No automatic retries are enabled.

```python
from msgflux.nn import Agent
from msgflux.runtime import AgentApprovals
from msgflux.tools.builtin import DeleteTool, EditTool, WriteTool

agent = Agent(
    name="editor",
    model=model,  # your configured chat-completion model
    tools=[WriteTool(cwd="/"), EditTool(cwd="/"), DeleteTool(cwd="/")],
    checkpoint_store=checkpoints,  # an atomic checkpoint store
    approvals=AgentApprovals(
        journal,
        {"write": "implementation:v1", "edit": "implementation:v1",
         "delete": "implementation:v1"},
        policy_version="review:v1",
    ),
)
```

This registers all three tools with the existing host-owned approval policy.
File deletion requires both `filesystem.read` and `filesystem.delete` on the exact
file, not a write grant. Empty directories require `filesystem.list` and
`filesystem.delete` instead. `WorkspaceEditor.prepare_delete_target()` selects
the applicable proposal; `prepare_delete()` and `ApplyPatchTool` remain file-only.
Backends implement `deletion_directory_token()` and `checked_rmdir()` through
their protected hooks. In-memory comparison/removal is locked; the POSIX backend
uses descriptor-relative `rmdir` and the environment's cooperative guarantee.
It cannot promise atomic identity comparison against unrelated external writers.
These new proposal fields change digests; pending approvals created before this
change require a fresh review. Without
a policy (or with explicit `approvals=None` for a new invocation), calls execute
without confirmation but still require live workspace grants. A raw ToolLibrary
does not independently manage Agent approvals. Configure the policy whenever
human confirmation is required; native/function transport must not choose it.

For protected calls, the runtime prepares and checkpoints the exact file change
before emitting `tool.approval_required`. The journal binding includes both the
visible arguments and the prepared-change digest. After approval, the guard
revalidates the proposal and current policy and consumes the decision once; the
tool receives the prepared object through execution-local context, then applies
it with the same backend conflict checks. Initial invalid edits return a blocked
tool observation without writing or requesting approval. If an existing proposal
can no longer be reproduced, the Agent pauses for host review instead of silently
substituting a new diff. Multiple changes to the same file are not a transaction:
prefer a new model turn after each accepted change to that file.

```python
from msgflux.exceptions import TaskPauseRequestedError

async def run_with_review(agent, scope, render_event, review_change, reviewer_id):
    try:
        async for event in agent.stream_events("Update the configuration", scope=scope):
            render_event(event)
    except TaskPauseRequestedError:
        async with agent.watch(scope.thread_id) as watcher:
            requests = watcher.snapshot.approvals
        for record in requests:
            if record.status != "pending":
                continue
            preview = await agent.ainspect_approval_preview(
                record.binding.thread_id, record.binding.run_id, record.request_id,
            )
            if preview is None:
                continue  # use your ordinary approval UI for non-file tools
            # Render path/operation/diff safely and wait for an actual user choice.
            approved = await review_change(preview.path, preview.operation, preview.diff)
            await agent.adecide_approval(
                record.request_id, approved=approved, decided_by=reviewer_id,
            )
        # Resume explicitly with the same scope and live resources when ready.
```

The host authenticates the reviewer and authorizes access to the thread **before**
loading a preview. `inspect_approval_preview` and its async counterpart verify the
checkpoint proposal against the journal digest; they return a detached
`PreparedFileChange`, or `None` for a non-file approval. Events and watcher approval
records contain identifiers, not file diffs. For runtime-only policies, pass the
same `approvals=policy` to invocation, watch, inspection and decision methods.
Previews survive checkpoint/journal restart but never restore live permissions.
After the batch finishes its pending previews are cleared; retain an authorized
audit artifact separately if long-term review history is needed.

The provider-neutral `WorkspaceChangeTool` contract shares preparation/application
across the tools, including the patch frontend below.

### Tool transport adapter contract

Provider codecs implement `ToolTransportAdapter`, exported from
`msgflux.models.tool_adapters`. Its seven abstract methods are `declaration`,
`supports`, `validate_metadata`, `decode`, `render`, `project_history` and
`interrupted`. Both shell and patch inherit this contract. Implementations declare
provider/API, codec/version, logical kind and native item types as class attributes;
they remain stateless and never execute tools or restore authority. The codec
registry remains explicit application code, not checkpoint-selected imports.

```python
from msgflux.models.tool_adapters import ToolTransportAdapter
from msgflux.models.tool_adapters.openai_patch import OpenAIApplyPatchAdapter

adapter: ToolTransportAdapter = OpenAIApplyPatchAdapter()
declaration = adapter.declaration()  # {"type": "apply_patch"}; no execution
```

This inspects the protocol declaration without reading files or calling a model.
An adapter missing any abstract method cannot be instantiated.

### Apply patch with OpenAI Responses

`ApplyPatchTool(cwd="/")` creates, updates or deletes **one file per call** using
a V4A diff. It inherits the same WorkspaceChangeTool contract, so approval previews,
live filesystem grants and the environment-selected write guarantee work exactly
as for write/edit.
Creation refuses to overwrite an existing file; updates require an existing file;
deletion requires `filesystem.delete` as well as read permission for its preview.
Parent directories must already exist. There is no shell invocation, host-path
fallback, multi-file rollback, rename operation or automatic retry.

```python
from msgflux.models.providers.openai import OpenAIChatCompletion
from msgflux.nn import Agent
from msgflux.runtime import AgentApprovals
from msgflux.tools.builtin import ApplyPatchTool, ReadFileTool

model = OpenAIChatCompletion(
    model_id="gpt-5.4", api_mode="responses",  # choose a model supporting apply_patch
)
agent = Agent(
    name="patcher", model=model,
    tools=[ReadFileTool(), ApplyPatchTool()],
    checkpoint_store=checkpoints,
    approvals=AgentApprovals(journal, {"apply_patch": "implementation:v1"}, "review:v1"),
)
```

This enables the model-owned native binding by default: Responses receives
`{"type":"apply_patch"}` rather than a function schema. Its `apply_patch_call`
operation becomes a canonical tool intent; the tool still returns only a compact
result. The adapter produces `apply_patch_call_output` with `completed` or `failed`
status, retaining `call_id`. Failed or denied changes include an error observation.
See the [official protocol guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-apply-patch).
The application executes the operation locally through its configured workspace;
OpenAI does not perform these filesystem writes for it.

For ordinary function transport, construct the model with `native_tools=False`.
The tool then exposes `operation` (`create`, `update`, `delete`), `path` and nullable
`diff`. For example, an update uses:

```python
arguments = {
    "operation": "update",
    "path": "config.txt",
    "diff": "@@\n-mode=old\n+mode=new",
}
```

These are the canonical arguments accepted by the tool, not the native wire
envelope. Native Responses uses `create_file`, `update_file`, or `delete_file`
inside its `operation` object; only the adapter maps that representation. Create
diffs use `+`-prefixed content lines (an empty diff creates an empty file); delete
uses no diff. Supply a V4A **body**, not a multi-file `*** Begin Patch` envelope or
a standard numbered unified diff. Function transport preserves extra runtime
selectors such as `run_in_background` instead of silently dropping them, although
the current approval policy only supports foreground execution.

The parser is adapted from the OpenAI Agents SDK reference, with its MIT notice
preserved and parser records implemented as `msgspec.Struct`. It supports context
anchors, stacked anchors, EOF hunks and CRLF. It retains the reference whitespace
matching behavior; the UI shows a unified diff of the **actual proposed old/new
contents**, not merely the model's input patch. Single-file boundaries are stricter:
embedded file operations and ignored trailing payloads are rejected. No-op and
conflicting proposals become failed tool observations before effects.

Streaming accumulates the operation until its completed output item arrives;
partial diff events never execute a patch. Versioned transport metadata survives
approval pause/restart, and interrupted calls or host reconciliation use the same
adapter for continuation. Internal metadata is removed from provider requests.
Renaming the tool preserves its logical name in portable history. The normal
`inspect_approval_preview` API and host approval policy apply unchanged; omitting
the policy explicitly leaves confirmation to the host, without granting resources.

For custom frontends, `WorkspaceEditor.prepare_create(path, content)` and
`prepare_transform(path, transform)` expose the same create-only and
update-existing preparation. The transform is a trusted host-owned pure function,
not a callable supplied by the model or restored from checkpoints. Async variants
`aprepare_create` and `aprepare_transform` preserve execution context.

### Injecting a filesystem into tools

Declare runtime inputs explicitly, so they remain outside the model-facing schema:

```python
from msgflux.nn import ToolLibrary
from msgflux.tools.config import tool_config

@tool_config(runtime_inputs=["filesystem"], retry=False)
async def read_file(path: str, *, filesystem) -> str:
    """Read an authorized file in the virtual workspace."""
    return await filesystem.aread_text(path)

tools = ToolLibrary("files", [read_file])
with execution_context(scope=scope):
    text = await tools.arun("read_file", {"path": "/workspace/report.txt"})
```

This is an application-defined example, not a shipped `read_file` builtin. The
same tool can be passed to an Agent invoked with this live scope. The runtime
supplies `filesystem`; model arguments and `vars` cannot supply a substitute.
Missing bindings fail before tool execution. The VFS checks the actual `path`
when called and raises `PermissionError` on denial. It also checks an already
aborted scope before attempting an operation. Cancelling an async await cannot
undo a write that already completed in the backend's worker thread.

For tools accessing a fixed resource, `@tool_config(required_resources=[...])`
adds mandatory preflight checks to the canonical ToolLibrary boundary and local/
MCP adapters. Construct requirements using `ResourcePermission(resource, action)`
or `filesystem.permission(...)`. `required_permissions` remains independent:
declaring both requires both grants. Static requirements neither authorize a
dynamic path by themselves nor stop arbitrary Python from using host APIs.

### Process executors

`ProcessExecutor` is an abstract, host-supplied backend. **No shell or OS sandbox
backend is included.** An environment without one refuses process execution:

```python
from dataclasses import replace
from msgflux.runtime import ProcessRequest

process_scope = replace(scope, permissions=PermissionSet(["process.execute"]))
with execution_context(scope=process_scope):
    try:
        await environment.arun(ProcessRequest(("bash", "-lc", "pwd")))
    except PermissionError:
        pass  # No executor configured; nothing was launched on the host.
```

The builtin `bash` declares `runtime_inputs=["environment"]` and calls
`environment.arun(...)`. It receives the same workspace as `read_file` and does
not fall back to `subprocess` when the backend cannot use that workspace.

Before calling a backend, the environment checks `process.execute`, declared
`SandboxCapabilities`, workspace compatibility and cancellation. Default
`SandboxRequirements` require filesystem, network, process and resource-limit
mechanisms. The trusted host owns any explicit relaxation. A backend must enforce
the requested policy, the passed live resource grants, virtual cwd, timeout and
output limit. It must not inherit the host's filesystem, credentials or environment
implicitly. Cancellation must terminate/reap its children before cleanup returns.

`ProcessRequest` carries explicit argv, a virtual cwd, timeout and output byte
limit; `ProcessResult` carries return code and byte stdout/stderr. The runtime
requests cancellation on timeout and rejects oversized returned output, but the
backend must bound capture while running. Declaring capabilities is a contract,
not proof of OS isolation. The current tests use a fake backend, never real bash.

!!! warning "Current boundaries"
    The memory VFS is process-local and has no persistence, quotas or artifact
    resolver. Files are not checkpointed. Filesystem/network enforcement for real
    processes, mounts/materialization, synchronization, shell emulation and durable
    workspace versions remain future backend work. A VFS is not a Python sandbox.

    Host tools, extensions and backend implementations remain trusted code.
    Resource IDs are exact opaque names, not wildcard policies. Network resource
    interpretation belongs to a future enforcing backend. Approval bindings include
    static requirements, workspace identity and isolation mechanisms, but do not
    pin file contents or inspect shell commands. Change host policy/tool revisions
    when those implementations or their security meaning change.

### Ready-to-use workspace tools

`ReadFileTool` and `BashTool` use the same live dependencies described above. Add
them explicitly to a ToolLibrary or an Agent; they are not enabled automatically.

```python
from msgflux.nn import ToolLibrary
from msgflux.runtime import (
    ExecutionEnvironment,
    ExecutionScope,
    InMemoryWorkspace,
    PermissionSet,
    execution_context,
)
from msgflux.tools.builtin import BashTool, ReadFileTool

workspace = InMemoryWorkspace("report", {"/report.txt": b"Quarterly report"})
scope = ExecutionScope(
    environment=ExecutionEnvironment(workspace),
    permissions=PermissionSet(
        resources=[workspace.permission("/report.txt", "filesystem.read")],
    ),
)
tools = ToolLibrary("workspace_tools", [ReadFileTool(), BashTool()])

with execution_context(scope=scope):
    text = tools.run("read", {"path": "/report.txt"})
    assert text == "Quarterly report"
```

This example reads only the authorized virtual file, not a host path. The async
equivalent is `await tools.arun("read", {"path": "/report.txt"})` inside
the same execution context. For an Agent, pass `tools=[ReadFileTool(), BashTool()]`
and supply the live scope to its call. `filesystem` and `environment` are injected
runtime inputs, excluded from model schemas; arguments cannot replace them.

`ReadFileTool` is exposed as `read(path, offset=None, limit=None)`. It accepts an absolute
virtual path and returns strict UTF-8 text by default. There is no separate
`read_file` Python function or shared default instance.

For host-configured instructions, use a separate `ReadFileTool` instance for each
agent. Guidance is optional and is not shared between instances:

```python
from msgflux.tools.builtin import ReadFileTool

reader = ReadFileTool()
reader.tool_config["usage_guidance"] = (
    "Use this tool for text files. For image interpretation, explicitly "
    "delegate to an available vision agent."
)
tools = ToolLibrary("reader", [reader])
```

This example provides guidance appropriate to a text-only main agent when a
vision agent is available. It does not delegate automatically. For an agent whose
model accepts image messages, enable image publication explicitly:

```python
class ProjectReader(ReadFileTool):
    """Read project files and optionally attach images."""

    tool_config = {
        **ReadFileTool.tool_config,
        "usage_guidance": "Read only files relevant to the current task.",
    }

reader = ProjectReader(supports_vision=True)
```

The constructor copies `tool_config` to the instance and appends an instruction
explaining that images arrive in a subsequent user-role message linked to the
tool call. Existing `tool_config["usage_guidance"]` is preserved; neither the
class configuration nor other instances are modified. `usage_guidance` is not
a constructor argument. Configure it before adding the instance to a library.
The vision flag is host configuration, not a model argument;
it does not change the model's capabilities. The default is `supports_vision=False`.

PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP paths are recognized by their filename MIME type. Image
bytes are read through the same authorized VFS, encoded with the existing `Image`
helper and published through `handle.get_notification().message(...)`. No host
path is opened by the encoder. This is format routing, not image integrity or
provider compatibility validation. Other image formats, images with vision
disabled, or publication without an inbox raise errors. Standalone ToolLibrary
calls normally have their own inbox; an Agent is needed to consume that inbox
into a model conversation. The result is only a short publication confirmation,
not base64 text. In foreground Agent execution, the attachment follows the tool
results before the next model request.

Both tools define explicit `annotations` containing only model-visible inputs
and the return type. Runtime dependencies remain in `runtime_inputs`, not that
mapping. Forged public arguments that collide with injected dependencies are
rejected before execution. Their UI labels are `Read` and `Bash`.

### Reading a window and configuring the working directory

```python
reader = ReadFileTool(cwd="/project")
shell = BashTool(cwd="/project")
tools = ToolLibrary("workspace_tools", [reader, shell])

with execution_context(scope=scope):
    snippet = tools.run("read", {"path": "src/main.py", "offset": 20, "limit": 40})
```

The example reads up to 40 lines starting at line 20 of `/project/src/main.py`;
`scope` must authorize that exact virtual file. The result is only the selected
text, preserving LF/CRLF line endings, without a metadata wrapper. `offset` is
1-based and defaults to 1. `limit` defaults to 2000 lines and is capped at 2000.
Both must be positive integers when supplied. An offset past EOF is an error;
an empty file at offset 1 returns an empty string. Multiple ranges are not exposed.

Only the selected text is decoded as UTF-8 and checked against the 1,000,000-byte
output ceiling. A small window of a larger file is allowed. A selected window
that exceeds the byte ceiling is rejected rather than silently cutting a line.
Image reads reject explicit offset/limit and retain their existing size ceiling.

`WorkspaceFilesystem.read_lines`/`aread_lines` authorize the same `filesystem.read`
resource as `read_bytes`. Backends can implement `_read_lines` for bounded I/O;
the compatibility implementation reads the source bytes once, scans newline
positions and slices only the requested window. It does not split or decode the
whole file, but does not promise bounded backend I/O for legacy implementations.
Backends must enforce storage quotas and coherent reads as appropriate.

`cwd` is constructor configuration, never a model argument or the host process's
working directory. Relative read paths are resolved under it; absolute virtual
paths remain allowed when authorized. Traversal (`..`) is still rejected. This
cwd is not a security root: permissions and the sandbox define accessible paths.
When changing constructor configuration for an approval-protected tool, update
its host-owned implementation revision. A generic Agent resource container is
not introduced; live resources still come from `ExecutionScope.environment`.

`BashTool` is exposed as `bash(command, timeout_ms=None)` through function calling.
Output budgets are internal execution controls, not model arguments. It requests
`bash --noprofile --norc -c <command>` from the environment's executor. The entire
command is one argv element; shell syntax is intentionally interpreted by Bash
inside that executor. The executor must provide Bash, enforce the live resource
grants and isolation requirements, and prevent inherited host environment or
startup hooks such as `BASH_ENV`. `process.execute` alone does not grant file or
network access. No command inspection here establishes which resources it uses.

The host ceilings are 30 seconds per command and 1,000,000 combined output bytes
per batch. The requested timeout may reduce the deadline, never increase it. A
single command and a batch both return `ShellResult`, a `msgspec.Struct` from
`msgflux.tools.shell`. Its `results` tuple contains `ShellCommandResult` records
with `status` (`exited`, `timed_out`, or `not_executed`), `stdout`, `stderr`, and
`returncode` (only set for an exited process). Function calling serializes this
canonical result as JSON. Commands in a batch execute in order,
in independent Bash processes with the same initial virtual cwd; `cd` and shell
variables do not persist between commands. After the output budget is exhausted,
remaining commands are not started and receive an explanatory error result.
Invalid UTF-8 in process output is
replaced for display. Automatic retries are disabled to avoid duplicating shell
effects. Cancellation, cleanup and bounded output capture follow the executor
contract above; this tool does not add durable process execution or live stdout
deltas.

`allow_background=True` injects only `run_in_background`, not a timeout. The
tool's `timeout_ms` limits each process execution; the separate `TaskWaitTool.timeout`
only limits how long a caller waits for a background task result, without changing
the process deadline. Background execution does not bypass the shell's time cap.
For example, configure `shell.tool_config["allow_background"] = True` before
building the ToolLibrary. Existing approval restrictions for foreground tools
still apply.

An asyncio subprocess backend should disconnect stdin, enforce output limits
during capture, and terminate and reap the process tree on timeout/cancellation.
Collecting all output with `communicate()` and truncating afterward does not
provide bounded memory. These responsibilities belong to the configured isolated
executor, not a subprocess fallback inside the tool.

### Native local shell in OpenAI Responses

`BashTool()` declares the provider-independent `shell` tool kind. The model owns
the binding, enabled by default through `native_tools=True`. With the OpenAI
Responses provider, its adapter emits
`{"type": "shell", "environment": {"type": "local"}}`. The model's
`shell_call.action.commands` become the same canonical tool arguments used by
the tool library; permissions, policies, approvals and the execution environment
remain in that path. Results return as `shell_call_output`, not a JSON-encoded
`function_call_output`. This is local execution by your configured backend, not
an OpenAI-hosted container. See the [OpenAI shell contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-shell).

The tool contains no OpenAI configuration or wire-format results. For example:

```python
from msgflux.models.providers.openai import OpenAIChatCompletion

model = OpenAIChatCompletion(model_id="your-shell-capable-model", native_tools=False)
```

This model uses function calling, including for `BashTool()`. Other providers and
Chat Completions also retain function calling unless they implement a native
adapter. A native shell can have any logical tool name, but only one shell tool
can be bound per request, and it cannot use deferred loading. Use function mode
for those configurations. Explicit selection of that native tool
is translated to `tool_choice={"type": "shell"}`. The host must select a model
that supports the shell tool; the runtime does not silently retry unsupported
native requests through function calling.

When a shell schema includes `run_in_background` or other inputs not representable
by the native shell protocol, the adapter selects function calling at request
construction. This preserves those controls instead of silently dropping them;
it is not a retry after a provider error.

For custom implementations, `tool_kind="shell"` is a contract, not merely a
display category: the implementation must accept a command batch through
`command`, optional `timeout_ms`, and return `ShellResult`.
Use another kind for tools with a different interface. Provider wire fields such
as `max_output_length` stay in versioned transport metadata and the provider
continuation, not in tool arguments or the public function schema.

Streaming accumulates only completed shell-call items; it never executes partial
command text. Native calls/results survive history and checkpoint serialization,
and pending approvals retain versioned codec metadata and the logical name on
resume. This metadata is not a tool argument, is not sent to the provider, and
does not grant execution authority. Unknown codec versions are rejected before
replaying an approval. Routing is local to each request, including streaming.
Experimental shell approval snapshots from before versioned transport metadata
are not automatically migrated; do not resume them as a different tool protocol.
For host reconciliation of a native shell batch, the confirmed text value must
be canonical JSON, for example
`{"results": [{"status": "exited", "returncode": 0, "stdout": "ok", "stderr": ""}]}`,
with one result per command. The provider adapter converts it to Responses.
Invalid results are rejected rather than assigned an invented success status.
The current executor contract cannot recover partial captured output when its
await times out, so that timeout observation has empty stdout. Abort/cancellation
still propagates; it is not converted into successful completion or retried.

!!! warning "No default shell execution"
    The example intentionally has neither `process.execute` nor a process
    executor: `bash` will refuse to run. To enable it, the host must supply a
    trusted `ProcessExecutor` through `ExecutionEnvironment` and grant the needed
    permissions. This release supplies the integration contract, not a concrete
    sandbox backend, and never falls back to the host shell. Approval integration
    is opt-in through `AgentApprovals`; resource grants do not substitute for
    user confirmation when your application requires it.

## Durable commit observation (experimental)

`agent.watch_commits(thread_id, run_id)` observes checkpoint transactions, not
model deltas. It works across SQLite connections and process restarts. Memory
storage only survives for the lifetime of its store instance. A run must have
at least one new-format atomic commit before it can be observed.

```python
from contextlib import aclosing
from dataclasses import asdict

async with aclosing(agent.watch_commits("catalog:42", "publication:1")) as pages:
    async for page in pages:
        if page.snapshot is not None:
            render_snapshot(page.snapshot)
        for event in page.events:
            render_transition(event.event_id, event.data)
        save_cursor(asdict(page.cursor))
```

The first page contains an atomic snapshot and its cursor, with no old events.
Subsequent pages contain only committed transitions. Persist the cursor **after**
processing the entire page. Renderers should deduplicate by `event_id` when
replaying a page after a consumer crash. Each event also carries its own cursor
for consumers that acknowledge individual events.

```python
from msgflux.data.stores import CheckpointCursor

cursor = CheckpointCursor(**load_cursor())
async with aclosing(agent.watch_commits(
    "catalog:42", "publication:1", after=cursor, limit=100, poll_interval=0.2,
)) as pages:
    async for page in pages:
        for event in page.events:
            render_transition(event.event_id, event.data)
        save_cursor(asdict(page.cursor))
```

This resumes strictly after the supplied cursor, without replacing the consumer's
existing snapshot. `CheckpointStore.read_commits(...)` and `aread_commits(...)`
offer the same API as individual reads; an empty events page means caught up.
The watcher polls until closed, including after terminal status. Closing it or
cancelling observation never sends cancellation to the producer.

Every new `commit_state` transaction stores one durable transition alongside its
snapshot, using the supplied event or a generic `checkpoint` event. Stable event
IDs combine a random stream incarnation and the checkpoint revision. Cursors
also bind namespace, thread and run. Deletion/recreation invalidates old cursors.
Missing history, unknown streams and invalid cursors raise `CheckpointCursorError`;
do not silently reset to a new snapshot when replay continuity matters.

Pages contain at most `limit` events (1–1000); slow readers leave their backlog in
storage instead of building a background queue. This bounds event count, not
payload bytes or the initial snapshot size. Events remain until the run is
deleted; this release does not implement retention/compaction of commit history.

!!! warning "Separate observation contracts"
    This is a run-scoped commit feed, not a thread-wide event bus. It does not
    replay token/reasoning deltas, `tool.start`, or every live `watch()` event.
    Approval decisions written to the separate approval journal are not magically
    part of a checkpoint transaction; reconciliation is, and emits a durable
    `approval.reconciled` transition. Read the journal to refresh decisions.

    `save_state`, `save_with_event`, `append_event`, and `load_events` retain their
    legacy behavior and are outside this feed's atomicity contract. Do not mix
    legacy writes with a run observed through commit cursors. Existing history is
    not backfilled; a legacy run gains a stream on its next atomic commit. Forks
    receive an independent stream on their first atomic commit.

    Cursor possession grants no access. The host must authorize observation and
    protect snapshots and event payloads, which may contain application data.

## Abort Signal

`AbortSignal` is local runtime cancellation for the currently active process.
It is useful for UI and CLI controls such as pressing `Esc` while a model is
generating. It is carried by `ExecutionScope` and exposed through
`get_execution_context().get("abort_signal")`.

```python
abort_signal = mf.AbortSignal()
scope = mf.ExecutionScope(
    thread_id="refund_conversation_42",
    run_id="refund_summary_01",
    abort_signal=abort_signal,
)

# From another UI/CLI control path:
abort_signal.abort("User pressed Esc.")
```

Providers observe the signal before output starts. After the first model token
or tool call is produced, that model response is treated as committed; abort is
then observed only at the next safe runtime boundary, such as before executing
tools or before a later model call. When an abort reaches `Agent`, msgFlux
converts it into the durable interrupt semantics: open tool calls are closed
with synthetic interrupted outputs, and the checkpoint/task status becomes
`interrupted`. The canonical timeline retains that status for audit. If the
timeline is later converted to Responses input, the corresponding
`function_call_output` uses the protocol's `incomplete` wire status.


## Revisioned checkpoints

Checkpoint providers that support atomic commits expose a monotonically increasing
revision. A runtime checkpoint can carry `branch_id`, `head_item_id`, and durable
extension state alongside the message snapshot. Writers pass the revision they
loaded as `expected_revision`; a competing writer raises
`CheckpointConflictError` instead of overwriting newer state. Legacy providers
continue to support ordinary `save_state` calls, but do not provide this CAS
guarantee.

`AgentRun.durable_state()` preserves budgets, extension state, run lineage, and the
active branch so extensions can resume without allocating a new run or resetting
limits.

```python
from msgflux.data.stores import InMemoryCheckpointStore

store = InMemoryCheckpointStore()
first = store.commit_state(
    "agent", "thread", "run", {"status": "running"},
    expected_revision=0, event={"event_type": "checkpoint"},
)
second = store.commit_state(
    "agent", "thread", "run", {"status": "completed"},
    expected_revision=first.revision, event={"event_type": "checkpoint"},
)
```

This example atomically writes each snapshot and its event. Reusing
`first.revision` after the second commit raises `CheckpointConflictError`.
Invalid metadata or failed payload preparation does not publish a new revision.
The Agent uses this operation automatically with the built-in stores; direct
`save_state()` remains a legacy, unconditional snapshot operation.

Forks record `fork_of` provenance, reset the destination revision, and retarget
runtime identity to the destination run. A preserved scope tree retains its
active branch; an ordinary history starts at `root`. Resuming the fork writes
to the target run, never to its source. `load_latest_run()` selects the latest
updated **run**, not a context branch; the active branch lives in run metadata.

## Context scopes

Context scopes are nested conversation branches within the same execution. They
keep the same thread, run, and budgets. The built-in tools return a transition
command; the Agent applies it only after every tool call and output in the
current batch has settled. Opening a scope records the parent prefix and starts
a child branch. Closing returns to the parent and copies a summary into it.
Closing an already closed or root scope is idempotent, while closing a non-active
name raises a conflict.

Register the built-in tools when the model should decide when to enter and leave
a scope:

```python
from msgflux.tools.builtin import close_context_scope, open_context_scope
from msgflux.nn import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="investigator",
    model=model,
    tools=[open_context_scope, close_context_scope],
)
```

The tools emit a command mapping tagged as `context_scope_transition`. Only tools
registered with `tool_kind="context_scope"` may request transitions, and their
calls must be exclusive within a batch. The Agent applies the command after every call
and output in the current batch has settled, so a scope change cannot split a
partially completed tool batch. Applications can apply the same command directly:

```python
from msgflux.runtime import ContextScopeCommand, ContextScopeController

controller = ContextScopeController()
controller.apply_command(
    messages,
    ContextScopeCommand(action="open", name="research", summary="Research context"),
)
# The Agent continues on the research branch.
controller.apply_command(
    messages,
    ContextScopeCommand(
        action="close", name="research", summary="Research completed"
    ),
)
```

Summaries are recorded as assistant messages in the parent branch. The original
call and output remain paired in the canonical timeline; closed branches retain
their full snapshot in `ChatMessages.metadata` for recovery and inspection.
The metadata records lineage, active head, and scope revisions while the message
events remain append-only. Checkpoints therefore restore the active branch without
allocating a new `ExecutionScope`, thread, run, or budget.

## Iterative runtime validation

The repository includes `scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py` to exercise the
Agent runtime without application scaffolding. Its offline mode uses a scripted
model with the real event stream, tool dispatch, permission checks, approval
journal, checkpoints and AgentInbox. It requires no API credentials.

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py --deny
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py --interactive --events --repeat 2
```

The first command approves the scripted proposals automatically in a disposable
in-memory workspace. The second exercises rejection. The third prompts for
decisions and repeats the scenario with fresh state, making it easy to compare
different choices without modifying repository files.
The final JSON summary counts approved/denied file changes; shell decisions are
not file changes. `--events` prints event types and text deltas to stderr without
dumping image payloads. Interactive decisions show the prepared diff and default
to denial on a blank answer or EOF. A separate permission probe attempts a write
through Agent with `approvals=None` and no resource grants, verifying that the
file remains unchanged; its permission-denied log is expected.

Run the harness regressions with
`uv run pytest -q tests/test_agent_runtime_playground.py`. For the full offline
suite, use `uv run pytest -q --ignore=tests/integration`, matching CI. Some existing
integration tests load `.env` and contact live providers; bare `pytest` is not an
offline-only command.

The scenario reads a bounded range of text, proposes workspace changes through
write/edit/apply-patch tools, and reads an image with vision support enabled. The
image is delivered as a subsequent user-role message associated with the tool
call, not embedded in the tool's text output. Approval pauses let the host inspect
the prepared diff, record a decision and resume execution.

!!! warning "What this validates"
    An offline image check validates delivery and provenance, not visual
    understanding. The demonstration shell is simulated: it never executes host
    commands and does not establish OS sandbox guarantees. Workspace, journal and
    checkpoints are in memory; rerunning the scenario is not crash recovery.
    Removing approval prompts does not grant missing filesystem permissions.

### Try a real vision model

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py --live \
  --model YOUR_OPENAI_MODEL_ID --image /absolute/path/to/image.png --interactive
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment using your usual secret-management
workflow. The script does not load `.env` automatically. Choose a model that
supports vision and native apply-patch tools. `--live` explicitly opts into paid
Responses requests and transmission of the selected image and conversation.
Responses supports image inputs including base64 data URLs; see the
[official image-input guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/images-vision).

`--model` accepts either the bare model ID or `openai/MODEL`; the provider prefix
is not duplicated. For models without native shell/apply-patch support, select
function-tool transport explicitly:

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py --live \
  --model openai/gpt-4.1-mini --image ./msgFlow.ai.png \
  --no-native-tools --interactive
```

This keeps the same local tools, permissions and approval previews, changing only
their provider representation. There is no automatic retry with a different model
or transport. A non-success HTTP streaming response is read before extracting its
structured provider error, so API errors remain visible rather than being masked
by an unread-response exception.

The host imports at most 1 MB from the selected image into `/image.png` in the
virtual workspace. The Agent is asked to read it through `ReadFileTool`; that
tool publishes the image through AgentInbox for the next model request. File
changes still require approval. Bash is not exposed in live mode because this
harness has no process executor. Its simulated dispatch is covered offline;
adding a real executor is a separate host integration, not an approval override.

After the first answer, enter follow-up messages or `/quit`. Each turn uses a new
run in the same thread and continues from its in-memory checkpoint. Native patch
transport, image serialization and next-turn history are covered by offline
mocked-transport tests. Actual provider availability, visual interpretation and
model tool choices require manual live validation. There is no automatic vision
fallback or guarantee that a live model will choose every tool in the scenario.

For persistent recovery coverage, use the durability conformance gate described
in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The separate
`scripts/validate_openai_event_streaming.py` also exercises provider-specific
streaming with paid API requests; it is not part of offline validation.

### Live provider matrix and release stress gate

The opt-in `tests/integration/test_live_agent_provider_matrix.py` exercises a
real Agent with OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Baseten, Fireworks and NVIDIA. For
each configured provider it streams a tool call and its result, checks the
terminal event and SQLite checkpoint, reconstructs the Agent and continues the
thread. The test uses a small completion limit and a per-run timeout, but every
request can consume provider quota or incur charges. Default `pytest` skips
these tests; it never loads `.env` automatically.

```bash
# Export the provider API keys using your secret manager, then opt in:
MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_PROVIDER_MATRIX=1 \
  uv run pytest -q tests/integration/test_live_agent_provider_matrix.py

# Run just one provider with an explicit model or endpoint override:
MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_PROVIDER_MATRIX=1 \
MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_PROVIDERS=baseten \
MSGFLUX_LIVE_BASETEN_MODEL=zai-org/GLM-5.2 \
MSGFLUX_LIVE_BASETEN_BASE_URL=https://inference.baseten.co/v1 \
  uv run pytest -q tests/integration/test_live_agent_provider_matrix.py

# Require all six credentials and run the heavier offload/event-buffer case:
MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_PROVIDER_MATRIX=1 \
MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_STRESS=1 \
MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_REQUIRE_ALL=1 \
  uv run pytest -q tests/integration/test_live_agent_provider_matrix.py
```

The first command tests each selected provider with an available key; missing
ones appear as skips, not passes. An explicit provider filter or
`MSGFLUX_LIVE_AGENT_REQUIRE_ALL=1` fails collection if a selected key/model is
missing. The stress case runs an additional 512 KiB synthetic tool result,
checks its offloaded reference and hash, and measures event and checkpoint
sizes without printing the payload. Use `--junitxml=/trusted/path/report.xml`
with `-o junit_family=xunit1` to retain its per-provider timing and size
properties. Set `MSGFLUX_LIVE_<PROVIDER>_KEY_ENV` when the key has a
nonstandard variable name and `..._MAX_TOKENS` (1–4096) when the model needs a
different output cap. Model IDs and endpoints are defaults for validation, not
stable library promises; override them if your account uses another model or
deployment. The NVIDIA default is `openai/gpt-oss-20b`: both
`z-ai/glm-5.3` and `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` ended their streamed tool run without
producing a response type in live validation, so they are not reliable gate
defaults yet. `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4.1-flash` answered without calling the
required tool; `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` completed the stress case
but intermittently returned an overloaded-service error. They remain available
as explicit model overrides for diagnosis. The default also showed one
intermittent malformed tool call and one unexpected argument during repeated
validation, so keep per-run failures visible rather than treating a single
passing run as proof of provider reliability.

The test prefers each registered provider class. When a requested provider is
not yet registered in the checkout, it uses an explicit OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions adapter **inside the test only**. That fallback validates the wire
transport and Agent integration, not provider-specific behavior in a PR that
is not installed. Review the selected adapter when interpreting results.

For a repeatable local performance baseline, run the offline benchmark before
each release on the same hardware and Python version:

```bash
uv run python scripts/benchmark_agent_release.py \
  --iterations 500 --payload-bytes 512
uv run python scripts/benchmark_agent_release.py \
  --iterations 500 --payload-bytes 512 \
  --baseline /trusted/path/agent-baseline.json --max-regression 0.25
```

The first command emits JSON to stdout; save a reviewed result outside the
repository for the second command. The gate exits nonzero when a comparable
latency or peak-memory measurement exceeds the configured tolerance. It
exercises event delivery, scripted Agent tool turns and SQLite checkpoints
without making paid requests. Its numbers are machine-specific, so use a
consistent host and investigate failures rather than assuming a wall-time
change alone is a runtime regression. Live provider tests are a separate
functional gate; their timing is influenced by remote capacity and rate limits.

### Offline extension matrix

Run the same tool trajectory with fresh agents and stores for each combination:

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py --matrix
uv run python scripts/validate_agent_runtime.py --profile combined --interactive --events
```

The matrix crosses approval and denial with three profiles: `baseline` (Agent
defaults), `workspace` (dynamic workspace guidance), and `combined` (workspace,
fixed fixture date, few-shot guidance and a seven-round tool budget). The budget
allows the six tool rounds to complete; terminal exhaustion is not covered by
this scenario. Each profile checks prompt sections do not accumulate on resume,
file effects, streamed events, checkpoint history and image inbox provenance.
The matrix emits a JSON array identifying each profile and decision. It is
offline only; Bash remains simulated and files remain in memory. This is not
yet coverage of every extension, cancellation or a real local workspace.

The pytest harness regressions additionally cross a one-round terminal budget
with approval/denial on memory and local backends. Local tests use pytest-created
temporary directories, never the repository workspace. They verify the diff,
pause/resume, completed checkpoint and actual disk effects, with no extra model
request after the final tool round. This coverage does not enable a local CLI
mode or a host process executor.

Resume regressions also approve a proposed write and then revoke permissions,
change the principal, edit the file from the host, or interrupt through AgentInbox
before resuming the event stream. They check that no tool starts, no additional
model request occurs, the approval stays unconsumed and the current file survives.
Changed authority or content requires host reconciliation; an inbox interruption
records an interrupted checkpoint instead of a completed run.

External cancellation tests trigger an `AbortSignal` while the model or an async
tool is waiting. The Agent event stream raises `TaskInterruptRequestedError`,
the pending coroutine runs its cleanup, and the checkpoint is interrupted rather
than completed. Tests synchronize with events instead of timing sleeps. These
checks cover cooperative async cancellation, not rollback of completed external
effects or termination of an uncooperative host process.

The cancellation scenario then reuses the same Agent with a fresh run and abort
signal, both in the original thread and in a different thread. The new run must
complete one tool call with a fresh tool budget, without duplicating workspace
guidance or modifying the interrupted run's checkpoint. This is a new execution,
not replay or reconciliation of the interrupted operation's external effects.

Inbox outage tests inject a checkpoint failure after a queued text or image has
been incorporated into the conversation. The notification remains available;
after storage recovers, retry produces one committed delivery and excludes the
uncommitted assistant response. The model request is repeated in this scenario:
delivery deduplication does not mean exactly-once provider requests.

Consumer lifecycle tests explicitly close `stream_events()` while a model or
async tool is waiting. Closure must cancel and clean up the operation, leave an
interrupted checkpoint, and be safe to repeat. These tests do not establish a
bounded event queue or memory guarantees for slow consumers.

A separate finite slow-consumer case pauses reads until the producer commits,
then drains the buffered events. It verifies all 32 Unicode text deltas arrive
in order and match the checkpoint, followed by one terminal event. This checks
lossless delivery for that workload, not backpressure or an unlimited-load bound.

Artifact integration tests combine a protected write, approval or denial,
workspace guidance and an artifact response split into one- or seven-character
chunks. Event deltas and the final event contain the expanded report, while the
checkpoint and the next run's model input retain the original reference.
Unknown references remain literal and escaped references are not expanded.
The subsequent turn also checks that renderer state and prompt sections do not
leak across runs. Artifact registration is host-owned in these tests; this is
not automatic file loading or durable storage of artifact contents.

Compaction integration tests begin with a completed turn, compact that prefix,
open a work scope, pause for a write approval, then close the scope after approval
or denial. The three-round budget must survive the pause and scope transitions.
They verify one compaction, no pending tool calls in the compactor input, retained
original history, a closed child branch and the expected filesystem effect.
Compaction here precedes the protected call; the scenario does not authorize
rewriting a pending approval or compacting an unfinished tool batch.

Concurrency tests run two threads through the same Agent and tool library,
sharing the approval journal and checkpoint store. A barrier overlaps model
requests; each scope has its own workspace, principal and resource grants.
The runs deliberately reuse run and tool-call IDs while one write is approved
and the other denied. Tests verify separate approval IDs and previews, scoped
prompt permissions, independent budgets, file effects and checkpoint histories.
This is in-process concurrency over separate memory workspaces, not a guarantee
of transaction isolation for writers sharing the same physical file.

The process durability suite also runs a three-process approval scenario: pause
through the event stream, persist approval or denial and abruptly exit, then
reconstruct the Agent with SQLite stores in another process. Resume must settle
the terminal tool round without another model request or approval prompt. The
external effects database contains one entry after approval and none after
denial. This covers process death before dispatch, not a universal exactly-once
claim; separate reconciliation tests cover death after an external effect.

## Real isolated Bash with Docker

`DockerWorkspaceBackend` combines existing local workspace tools with
`DockerProcessExecutor`. Install a local Linux Docker daemon/CLI and provision a
trusted image containing Bash (and other programs you intend to expose). The
adapter never pulls images automatically. Prefer an immutable image ID/digest.

```python
from msgflux.runtime import (
    DockerLimits, DockerWorkspaceBackend, ExecutionEnvironment, ExecutionScope,
    PermissionSet, execution_context,
)
from msgflux.tools.builtin import BashTool

backend = DockerWorkspaceBackend(
    "/absolute/project/path", image=trusted_image_id,
    limits=DockerLimits(memory_bytes=256 * 1024 * 1024, pids=64, cpus=1),
)
async with await backend.open("project") as binding:
    environment = ExecutionEnvironment.from_binding(
        binding, write_guarantee="cooperative_compare",
    )
    scope = ExecutionScope(
        environment=environment,
        permissions=PermissionSet(
            ["process.execute"],
            [binding.filesystem.permission("/", "process.workspace")],
        ),
    )
    with execution_context(scope=scope):
        result = await BashTool().acall("printf 'hello'", environment=environment)
```

This runs an actual process in an ephemeral container and returns the same
`ShellResult` as other executors. Pass `scope` to an Agent to use its event stream,
approval policy and `ToolOutputOffloadExtension` normally. File tools still need
their own exact filesystem grants.

`process.workspace` is an explicit **whole-workspace read/write/delete grant**
for shell processes, not an alias for `filesystem.read`. The adapter refuses a
mount when only individual file permissions are provided. Relative Bash paths
start at the configured virtual cwd, mapped into `/workspace`; shell absolute
paths refer to the container, while file-tool paths remain virtual workspace
paths. The daemon mount path must refer to this same local machine.

Each command has a private container with network disabled, a read-only image
root, capabilities dropped, no-new-privileges, a non-root host UID/GID, PID and
memory limits, CPU quota and a limited `/tmp`. Only the selected workspace is
bind-mounted; recursive submounts are disabled. Image defaults are host-trusted;
application environment variables and credentials are not copied. This uses
[Docker run/create controls](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/)
and [resource limits](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/resource_constraints/).

Output is drained incrementally with backpressure. Timeout, cancellation and
sink failures reap the CLI and explicitly remove the named container (including
children). Cancellation waits for cleanup. Daemon failures may require host
reconciliation; the exception notes identify the container. Abrupt host process
death cannot run Python cleanup: the host must reconcile containers carrying
`msgflux.executor=ephemeral`. There is no distributed lease/reaper in this adapter.
Closing a binding requires the host to drain active calls first.

This is not protection against a compromised daemon/kernel, hostile local
administrators or concurrent replacement of the host mount path. Workspace
filesystem writes are real and are not rolled back. Memory/CPU/PID limits do not
provide a disk quota for arbitrary shell writes. `socket_path` may select another
trusted local Unix socket; remote daemon contexts are not supported. Do not
expose daemon access itself to the model.

To run deterministic real-container validation after provisioning
`python:3.12-slim` locally:

```bash
MSGFLUX_TEST_DOCKER=1 uv run pytest -q tests/test_docker_executor.py
```

These tests create temporary workspaces and owned containers; they never mount
the project source or the application's existing result store. They verify that
an individual file grant cannot launch a mounted container, a host-only
environment variable is absent inside it, and the daemon has removed the
ephemeral container after success, output-limit failure, timeout, cancellation,
or output-sink failure.
