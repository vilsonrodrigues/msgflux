[Customer]: It's 8842-B. This is really frustrating, I needed it for a presentation yesterday.
[Agent]: I completely understand. Let me pull up the tracking... it looks like there was a carrier delay. I can express-ship a replacement today at no charge and it will arrive tomorrow morning.
[Customer]: Oh, that's actually really helpful. So I'll get it tomorrow for sure?
[Agent]: Yes, guaranteed by 10 AM. I'll send the tracking link to your email right now.
[Customer]: Great, thank you. That's exactly what I needed.
